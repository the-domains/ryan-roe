With the release of cryptocurrency an unlimited set of opportunities have revealed themselves. This technology has created huge new markets. Cryptocurrency has challenged the global dollar standard, impacted the international monetary middleman, revolutionzed the crowdfunding process, and impacts the stock market sending shockwaves throughout the entire economy. The technology has created a conflict between centralization and decentralization that could change the entire landscape the global monetary system.</p>,<p>8 March 2018</p>,<p>Ryan Roe</p>,<p>Artwork from <a href="https://werk-schau.blogspot.com/2013/08/will-art-for-cash.html?showComment=1523334635238#c8984958777946706246" title="Peter Frölich's Blog">Peter Frölich</a></p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[About Me]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>About Me</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e84858ba-0c7d-4880-9614-2eb636a3a3ea.jpg">,<p>I am a Charleston native and intend to live there for the rest of my life.</p>,<p>I am a recent graduate from The University of South Carolina (USC) which developed my skills and experiences in two seemingly opposite directions.</p>,<p>The first area of growth is relationally as a manager of large scale social projects. I chartered a Social Philanthropy fraternity, Theta Chi, as a freshman with only 30 other people. Over the years I have taken the lead in almost every project whether it be social, organizational, institutional, philanthropic, or political as Vice President. The organization now maintains over 120 members. The connections and experience I gained awarded me an interview with the previous Student Body President, Ross Lordo, for a position on his cabinet as Director of Cockstock. Cockstock is USC’s name for a free homecoming concert built using a $100,000 conglomeration of 5 different student organization’s budgets. I was tasked with overseeing budget spending and coordinating these organizations, each consisting of their own bureaucracy to create successful event. Planning a concert of this size is not difficult: quote multiple venues, talent agencies, production companies, and security companies, poll the students, set up ticket sales, hire graphic designers, and then market through the appropriate channels. I utilized posters, stickers, tabling, talked alone in front of sorority meetings (200+ people), and utilized social media, particularly my friend’s account, Drinking Ticket. The difficult piece of Cockstock was politically extracting $100,000 from a state funded public university’s representatives as an undergraduate student. The Cockstock program is only in its second year, and this project required over 8 months of my time constantly meeting, calling, and coordinating. An unsuccessful event, high cost per head, would result in the cancellation of the budget allotment and the end of the program. The venue sold out at 10,000 people and I successfully planned the largest student run event at The University of South Carolina to date.</p>,<p>The second area of growth is technically as a student of Computer Science. Degrees in Computer Science teach students very little in the current academic climate and most knowledge is self-taught. The value in the degree comes with a general overview of the available technologies, a few projects, and the community I was introduced to. I have designed programs in Java, C++, TypeScript/CSS/HTML. I have built relational databased using SQL and constructed COBOL databases on IBM mainframes through a ISPF Unix Distribution, tn 3270x. I have garnered a tremendous interest in Linux and Hybrid Mobile Application Development technology. I am currently developing a mobile application, Beacon and contracting a revolutionary technology in the form of a hybrid mobile app dubbed FYI. I also have a fascination with many aspects of technology as you can see. This website is my technology project that grows along with me. The blog posts will focus on the history of technology, hybrid mobile application technology, the current climate of monetizing mobile applications, and breaking down complex technical subjects for easy introduction, specifically cryptocurrency, e-commerce, reprogrammable computing, Big Data (one of my favorites), and much more.</p>,<p>With Love - Ryan Roe</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNUcFqwkAQvecrlhRMAroxopU2iVDBg1B6aXsqpay7s5podpfdTaiU_nsnGqG3mXmPmffeFKLqSCXKUO4mVmsfrooUR6ugcNxWxq9i2SruK61iMSZujNyE_ASEdMySGntZO1ISQffgNydoQHm3Pr-x_QtrIHbJx_QzR3YlSfyfsz5vRYyrEmLBt1b1nGERt8A8DDzckCNAK4FYJa406izHNjp4b9xjmnKtFHBPJeOw0_pIFfgU1Nf7a-rEkdbu7lvumlOZjTqwDq2U3YxmsxEzZivKbL6cLueL6ex-9rDMFiPWev2s90_GbLreTZlF_Vn0SQ2zOHnRAmilHFi_BqktxEMOSR78xkLztlc-JtE1wQirm7JJ7VBRlCR5kQ75BkHRv4CfmHOXL3DdXFIMiWCeTQ4WZBnerNozU1bjeT3Aqm2MdqgyXNxe9weIVJld" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>
