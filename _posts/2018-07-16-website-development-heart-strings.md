# Website Development: Heart Strings

## This is a writeup of the first website/business solutions I have create for a client. I include a very useful workflow that integrates a website, scheduling, and accounting software allowing the task selection, scheduling, invoicing, and payment processing funnel to be completely automated.

Stacey Holley is creating a Geriatrics errand business servicing the Charleston, SC community. She reached out to me to assist here in developing a website and to acting as a technology/business/marketing consultant.

She is starting the business on her own, and as is the case with many of the individuals who comprise Generation X, the new technological frontier of the World Wide Web is rather daunting.

## She needed a business strategy that would involve a Website, Scheduling Plan, Accounting Software, and Marketing Plan.

### Website

Stacey needed needed no custom features in her website, but per her target market, it needed to be slick, quick, and intuitive. The website needed to be a one stop shop for her clients and represent her business properly because she lacked a storefront. After research into the available website creation strategies I chose Squarespace as the proper option. A Wordpress site would be cheaper monthly (~$5 vs $18) but the development time would be increased. Consequentially a Wordpress site would require more of an investment initially not only because of increased development time, but also because a template would need to be purchased, I would have to delve through the ridiculous amount pluggins which would without a doubt increase the monthly deficit beyond the benefit as well as create a patch-worked website. I would also have to handle mobile optimization, SEO, hosting, and much more beyond the time intensive html/css/js development the theme would no doubt require. Squarespace provided an intuitive website builder with free templates, and handles much of the background work necessary for a standard modern competitive website. Squarespace also provided integration with other platforms I required.

### Scheduling

Squarespace included a subscription to Acuity Scheduling with its Business Plan. This suited my client's needs perfectly because she needed her clients to be able to schedule themselves online. Acuity is a powerful scheduling platform. It offers many features that will be the foundation of entrepreneurs, small businesses, and medium business individuals. The platform allows the owner to create custom tasks/jobs that users can choose from available dates. The Acuity scheduler beautifully integrated into the Squarespace site.

Acuity offers multiple pricing tiers: $0, $15, $25, $50:

(Official term.)</p></article>

Features that are included with a paid subscription:

* Embed scheduler into your website
* Syncing with Outlook.com, Exchange, and Office 365
* Syncing with iCloud
* Syncing with Google Calendar
* GoToMeeting, Join.me, and Zoom integrations for online meetings
* QuickBooks, Freshbooks, and Xero integrations for invoicing and accounting
* MailChimp, AWeber, Constant Contact, ConvertKit, and MadMimi integration for bulk e-mailing
* Pipedrive integration for sales/CRM
* Integrate with 500+ other apps through Zapier
* Accept payments and deposits through PayPal, Square, Stripe, Braintree, or Authorize.net
* Vault credit cards for charging clients later
* Optionally let clients tip you
* Offer coupons and vouchers for discounts
* Offer classes, workshops, or group events
* Easy upsell clients with check-out add-ons
* Advanced reporting about appointments, no shows, & performance

Acuity also allows Square integration, allowing owners to accept payments through their scheduler, potentially ridding the use of purchasing accounting software. However, Accounting Software's were necessary, so we moved on to Quickbooks.

### Accounting Software

Quickbooks was chosen because my client was already familiar with the interface, and it integrates with Acuity. The integration allows an invoice/quote to be sent to a client automatically dependent upon a triggering event from Acuity, i.e. upon scheduling their appointment.

Stacey did not necessarily need these features so I supplied free options like Wave. However this does provide the platform for task selection, scheduling, invoicing, and payment processing funnel to be completely automated.

### Marketing Plan

Stacey's target market was the Baby Boomers and their adult children, Generation X. Squarespace included a $100 Google Adwords allotment (after $25 spent in Google Adwords), but this was not the best method to reach her target market. The best method was to send physical mail, supplemented by a smooth quick online experience and online advertising after a few initial clients were acquired. I instructed Stacey to create a nice flier that included her services, use online tools to find demographic data of surrounding neighborhoods, pull the address blocks, and use a company to send fliers to every doorstep of those neighborhoods. We then recorded a 3 minute video of Stacey introducing her business, which is put front and center on her website. Stacey also created business cards that she will leave along with the fliers at local medical practices.

### Other Business Necessities

I assisted Stacey with setting up an LLC for her company to create a limited liability bank account. I also recommended her to purchase a separate Business Number through GoDaddy. Stacey had already began pursuing a P.O. Box for her business.
