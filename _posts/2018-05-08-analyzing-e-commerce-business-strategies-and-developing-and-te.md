## Section 1 -- Introduction with Review of Literature

The extended research paper will discuss an analysis of e-commerce strategies for a new organization. The research paper begins to outline a successful e-commerce strategy by looking at the components of common e-commerce strategies that use technology as an advantage. A definition of e-commerce will then be defined and chosen to be utilized throughout the paper. The scope will be further honed to a focus on Mobile E-Commerce strategies. The global mobile application market will be studied in detail to provide a background for research on developing a mobile application e-commerce strategy. The paper will utilize this information to show that mobile applications are monetizable and to develop a very specific mobile application business model that will be tested. Every aspect of the mobile application's business model will be defined according to eight key elements of an e-commerce business model. The testing of the mobile application e-commerce business model example will begin the Fall of 2018, dubbed FYI.

This paper will utilize the book, _E-Commerce, _by Pearson Education to give a breakdown of the eight key elements to an e-commerce strategy as well as a definition for e-commerce. The definition of e-commerce is bolstered with an Elsevier Information and Management Journal article, "A Literature Review and Classification of Electronic Commerce Research" by Elizabeth Grandon. Statistical information on the global market of mobile applications is gathered from Statista & BusinessInsider then compiled by App Annie, a worldwide leader in mobile application analytics as well as BusinessofApps, Business of Apps provides app industry news, analysis, data & statistics for an audience of app and mobile professionals as well as an online marketplace for application development. App Annie's end of the year retrospective report for 2017 is also used to provide valuable current statistics on the mobile application economy. Mobile application specific revenue models are introduced by Localytics, an international mobile application analytics and marketing platform. Mobile application monetization is supplemented by a study from Tamoco, a website for precise location data for brands, apps, networks, and enterprise.

## Section 2 -- Research Objective and Analysis

According to the book, E. Commerce, by Pearson Education, a business model is "a set of planned activities (sometimes referred to as business processes) designed to result in a profit in a marketplace" (Pearson 60). Developing an e-commerce strategy requires an e-commerce business model.According to Pearson, an e-commerce business model "aims to use and leverage the unique qualities of the Internet, the Web, and the mobile platform" to generate a profit. Similarly a business strategy is a "set of plans for achieving superior long-term returns on the capital invested in a business firm" (Pearson 91). As you can see a business model and a business strategy are two very similar topics, but a business strategy will get more specific on the tasks necessary to create the return. A company's business model consists of 8 key elements: value proposition, revenue model, market opportunity, competitive environment, competitive advantage, market strategy, organizational development, and management team.

The internet is replete with articles discussing a successful e-commerce strategy because these strategies are so specific, how does one develop a competitive business strategy without a specific example? Let's examine each of the 8 elements of the business model. The two most noticeable elements are the value proposition and the revenue model. Why will a customer conduct business with a particular company over another? The answer to that question is the company's value proposition, which "defines how a company's product or service fulfills the needs of customers" (57). The company's value proposition is the heart and soul of the business idea, and choosing a businesses' idea is very important and should be based upon market research and be tied into the other 7 key business model elements. The next element is the revenue model which is just as it sounds: how a company is going to generate a return upon the investment. Many types of e-commerce revenue models exist: advertising revenue model, subscription revenue model, freemium strategy, transaction fee revenue model, sales revenue model, and the affiliate revenue model, and a proper understanding to each of them is necessary for selection.

The next element of an e-commerce business model is its intended market space or potential market share. That market share will further be broken up into smaller niches, especially in the e-commerce climate. "The realistic market opportunity is defined by the revenue potential in each of the market niches where you hope to compete" (62). Having an understanding of the potential market opportunities will prove useful in selecting a value proposition and for the success of the business. The internet has enabled millions of different small niches that are ripe for the picking, so that would be a great direction because attempting to compete with huge companies maintaining large market shares is nearly impossible for small businesses. Ecomdash is a successful online SaaS company that sells Multichannel Inventory Control Software for e-commerce sellers. They state that niche market products are easier to market, have higher search engine rankings, have less competition and therefore a higher chance of success (Ecomdash 1).

Competitive environment marks the fourth key element to an e-commerce business strategy. "A firm's competitive environment refers to the other companies selling similar products and operating in the same marketspace. It also refers to the presence of substitute products and potential new entrants to the market, as well as the power of customers and suppliers over your business" (Pearson 62). When weighing in options in regard to the competitive environment one must consider how many competitors are active, what the market share of each competitor is, how profitable these firms are, and how they price their products to name a few. Markets will have direct competitors who sell very similar products and indirect competitors who sell substitute products. One must be aware of the existence of too many competitors resulting a saturated market and greater difficulty in generating a profit.

The fifth key element to e-commerce is creating a competitive advantage in your market. According to Pearson a competitive advantage is "achieved by a firm when it can produce a superior product and/or bring the product to market at a lower price than most, or all, of its competitors" (63). Pearson sums up the ways that an e-commerce business can achieve an advantage:

* Firms achieve a competitive advantage when they can produce a superior product and/or bring the product to market at a lower price than most, or all, of their competitors (Porter, 1985).
* Firms also compete on scope. Some firms can develop global markets, while other firms can develop only a national or regional market. Firms that can provide superior products at the lowest cost on a global basis are truly advantaged.
* Firms achieve competitive advantages because they have somehow been able to obtain differential access to the factors of production that are denied to their competitors---at least in the short term (Barney, 1991).
* A first-mover advantage is a competitive market advantage for a firm that results from being the first into a marketplace with a serviceable product or service. This lacks complementary resources, so it is risky.

It does not matter how great a company or product is if they do not have a sound marketing strategy. The sixth key element of a business model can cripple a project before it even starts. This strategy refers to the plan that details exactly how the firm "intends to enter a new market and attract new customers" (Pearson 65). Some common marketing strategies for e-commerce ventures are (Walker):

1. Compose an executive summary
2. Identify your goals and objectives
3. Craft a mission statement and value proposition
4. Target the right customers and market(s)
5. Conduct a situational analysis
6. Develop a pricing and positioning strategy
7. Optimize your distribution and fulfillment plan
8. Create a cross-channel promotion plan
9. Inventory existing marketing assets
10. Construct a conversion strategy
11. Explore joint ventures and partnerships
12. Detail a strategy for increasing orders
13. Deploy a referral strategy
14. Outline financial projections

Many new entrepreneurial e-commerce ventures begin with one individual and slowly grow over time. Planning for this growth is the seventh key element to the e-commerce business model. This is known as Organizational Development. The company must have a plan to organize the work that needs to be accomplished. "Typically, work is divided into functional departments, such as production, shipping, marketing, customer support, and finance" (Pearson 65). At the beginning of a venture, the same person will be doing multiple of the jobs required for each department. However, as the company grows more and more people will be hired. Eventually each department will be broken down and multiple people will be handling each department.

Pearson considers the final element to be the most important part of the e-commerce business model, the Management Team. This is the people running the idea. This is the people making the project succeed. "A strong management team gives a model instant credibility to outside investors, immediate market-specific knowledge, and experience in implementing business plans." The managers of a project themselves can be the source of a competitive advantage that helps a project succeed. They may not be able to "salvage a weak business model, but the team should be able to change the model and redefine the business as it becomes necessary (Pearson 66).

The definitive scope of e-commerce has grown exponentially in the past decade and there is no exhaustive definition as the topic continues to transform and grow. Multiple definitions are required. The traditional view of e-commerce is simply an online store, or "the process of buying and selling products or services using electronic data transmission via the Internet and the www" (Grandon). Pearson gives a more general description by saying that e-commerce is "the use of the Internet, the Web, and mobile apps and browsers running on mobile devices to transact business. More formally, digitally enabled commercial transactions between and among organizations and individual." A literature review conducted in 2002 of over 270 academic journals defines e-commerce based on four perspectives (Ngai):

* From a communications perspective, e-commerce is the delivery of information, products/services, or payments via telephone lines, computer networks, or any other means.
* From a business process perspective, e-commerce is the application of technology toward the automation of business transactions and workflow.
* From a service perspective, e-commerce is a tool that addresses the desire of firms, consumers, and management to cut service costs while improving the quality of goods and increasing the speed of service delivery.
* From an online perspective, e-commerce provides the capability of buying and selling products and information on the Internet and other online services.

For this paper we will not be focusing on a traditional online store that buys and sells goods but on e-commerce from a communications and service perspective. The business model that will be developed is for a mobile application that delivers information as a service that addresses the desires of consumers. The development of the business model will follow the eight key elements described earlier. This business model will be implemented in reality as a business venture. The results of the study (success or failure) may be released at the end of Fall 2018\.

A study on the world of global applications proves beneficial to answer the question, why choose a mobile application platform when they may be known to be notoriously difficult to monetize.

Figure 2: Mobile Application Revenue provided by Statista compiled
by App Annie

In 2015 the total revenue generated across all mobile operating systems was about $70 billion, in 2016 this number reached $88 billion. By 2020 the combined mobile app revenue will reach a staggering $189 billion (Fig 2). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aa5dbd07-1d6a-4162-91d2-24b2ed76036b.png)

Figure 3: Application Monetization as a Share of Worldwide revenue
provided by Statista compiled by App Annie

Gradually, year-over-year in-app purchases began to take over other monetization models and by 2017 way over 50% a mobile app revenue is generated via in-app purchases (Fig 3). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adfea062-200b-447b-9569-fbb5cd277e66.png)

Figure 4: Global Paid-Application Revenue provided by Statista
compiled by App Annie

There is a growing trend that mobile app users do not download new apps as much as they used to and regularly utilize the same applications. In 2011, two years after in-app purchase were introduced, until 2017 revenue went up from $7 billion in 2011 to $29 billion in 2017, but starting in 2015, there is a clear stalling in paid-for application growth, which can be attributed to the mobile app ecosystem maturity (Fig 4).

Figure 5: Total Worldwide In-Application Revenue provided by
Statista compiled by App Annie

In 2011 in-app purchases generated $712 million, but by 2017 in-app purchases generated $37 billion which beats paid for apps by $8 billion (Fig 5, Dogtiev, Statista).

Figure 6: Genres of Advertisements by Revenue Provided by
BusinessInsider

To find new revenue, developers began advertising inside of applications. "There are four major genres of mobile ads -- Display, Search, Social and Video." Search advertisements has been the primary competitor. The distribution is in Figure 6 (BusinessInsider). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a1e8982a-8b2c-48c7-aeef-0dcb644ebf89.png)

Figure 7:Application Revenue by Platform provided by App Annie

The iOS App Store has proven to be more lucrative than Google's Android because of Apple's walled garden approach combined with top notch hardware, software, and brand recognition. In 2017 Apple's iOS generated $40 billion, Google Play $21 billion and third-party stores generated $20 billion (Fig 7).

Figure 8: Application Revenue by Category

If application revenue is separated by category of app, gaming is by far the leader. In 2017 mobile gaming revenue claimed 49% of total revenue while the other 19 categories claimed the other 51% (Fig 8). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5ef557f9-e456-40d2-93fd-4136194f8327.png)

The top non-game revenue can be seen in Figure 10 (Dogtiev). ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dfe26027db00403177b75fb5962c359b79f550ca.png)

Figure 11 [Localytics][0]

One of the best ways to understand the effectiveness of an application is to measure the monthly retention. "Since 2016, average one month, two month and three month retention has increased by 11%, 22% and 28% respectively, which equates to an average increase of 20% across the board. Additionally, monthly churn, or people who do not return to an app, has decreased by an average of 7%" (Localytics, Fig 11). ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4c47befb3c578b41f4b2cec3cfce75feb7634087.png)

Figure 12

This could prove disheartening to new application developers, but the data shows that users have a strong appetite for applications: "In most markets analyzed, the average smartphone user has more than 80 apps on their phone and uses close to 40 of them each month. This roughly equates to between one-third and one-half of the apps on users' phones used each month on average" (App Annie, Fig 12). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ee5058be-a4ae-4a31-9b1c-d5383d528835.png)

Consumers have exceed spending $86 billion in 2017 which is up 105% from 2015 (Fig 14).

Figure 16

Global application downloads exceeded 175 billion in 2017 which is up 60% from 2015 and users spend over 3 hours of their days in mobile applications (Fig 15, Fig 16).

## Six common revenue models for mobile applications

Six common revenue models for mobile applications exist (Munir). The first is a free download, but with in-app advertising.Revenue is derived from selling data-driven advertising space in the application. The develops can find advertisers independently or work with partners that provide the advertisements for them. Common examples are social media applications like Facebook. There are a few different types of in-app advertisements. Banner ads were the original are the original in-app advertisement but quickly faded out because of extremely negatively impacting the user's experience. The second type is Interstitial Ads which came about because developers wanted an alternative to banner ads. One potential solution to this problem of how intrusive banners ads were "was to take the same ads and show them as a full-screen ad to the user. This occurs between separate user flows." Not ruining the user experiences requires a strong knowledge of the applications user flow. The third type of in-app advertising is native ads. Native advertisement integrate seamlessly into the look and design of the application. A common example is ads in the Facebook timeline. Native ads have a higher engagement rate, but is it tricking the user into clicking the ad? "The key is to make the native ad look and feel 'native' whilst also providing a clear indication to the user that the content they will land on is an advert." The fourth type of in-app advertisement is affiliate advertisements. Affiliate advertisements garner commission from other products. Affiliate advertisement work by recommending the advertisement based upon the users experiences and trust of the current application. The final example is reward advertisements which offer users incentive to use the app, but provide rewarding deals and advertisements if they engage with content. Another possibility for advertising is to utilize push notifications.

Pros

* Mobile apps are in a prime position to collect tons of data on their users (such as their in-app behavior and their location)
* Allows you to gain users quickly because people love free apps
* Can be effective if moderate and targeted advertising is used (ads are interesting yet limited)

Cons

* Not an innovative model and people can get annoyed of ads, which may lead to app churn
* Mobile ads can comprise your app experience by claiming a portion of the already limited screen size
* This model won't work for niche or utility apps that are designed to help users perform important functions (ads will be too unnatural and intrusive in this setting when people just want to do something quickly)

The second mobile application revenue model is Freemium. With this strategy users are allowed a free download, but are only able to use a portion of the app's functionality. Once users are committed, then they are willing to purchase the extra features. A common application of this category is Angry Birds.

Pros

* This mobile business model makes it easy to build up a large user base and showcases your app so people get attached then upsell
* People who "try before they buy" are more likely to become engaged and loyal users later on
* Flexible model because it can be adapted to almost any vertical

Cons

* If you offer too few features for free, app churn will be high
* If you offer too many features for free, it will be difficult/complex to convince your existing user base to pay for an upgrade (upgrade won't have much incremental value)
* App marketers must be careful not to provide a large segment of their users (the free ones) with an inferior app experience

The third mobile application revenue model is paid apps. Users must purchase the application before they use the application. The application must have superior marketing and the ability to convince users to buy instead of use free substitutes.

Pros

* App developers and app marketers earn revenue upfront with every new download
* People who have paid for an app are more likely to turn into engaged users (since they spent money to purchase your app vs. choosing a free one)
* In this model, the app does not usually have any in-app advertising thus allowing it to have a cleaner interface
* This model motivates app developers to focus on innovation since people expect paid apps to be the crème of the crop

Cons

* Selling an app is difficult because app stores are so overcrowded (stiff competition from many free apps)
* App stores take a cut of the revenue from paid apps (Apple gets approximately 30%)
* Paid models are a shrinking part of app store revenue
* 90% of paid apps are downloaded less than 500 times per day (cost-barrier to gaining a large number of users)

The fourth strategy to monetize mobile applications is In-App Purchases (Selling Physical/Virtual Goods). This model constitutes two different ideas. The first is creating a sales channel for real world purchases. The second is creating a mobile storefront for virtual good that are used within the application. "Apple and Google both take 30% of every in-app purchase through your app" (Ewan). Transaction fees play a part in this model as well. For applications that create user marketplaces, fees can be deducted from both parties. A new form of application has begun taking form of financial transaction applications where developers can institute a fee as well.

Pros

* This app business model works particularly well for eCommerce/mCommerce brands and is flexible enough for other verticals too
* In-app purchases can help app marketers make comfortable profits with the lowest amount of risk
* Buying virtual goods can lead to deeper levels of engagement (growing monetization strategy)
* The profit margin is usually high with this model because brands don't have the traditional expenses on mobile that brick-and-mortar stores do (like staffing and rent)
* Flexible model which can also be adapted to include affiliate programs and partnerships that drive referral revenue

Cons

* App stores usually take a cut of the revenue for virtual goods (but not physical goods or services) purchased inside an app
* Recently, this model has received bad publicity because government officials are pressuring Apple and Google to add stricter regulations to prevent children from making accidental in-app purchases
* Apps will need to be more transparent on their app store listing page if they include in-app purchases (which may prevent some people from downloading)

The fifth form of mobile application monetization is Subscriptions. Users are sometimes allowed to access a limited amount of data or services and sometimes they must subscribe to access any data. A common application of this model is Spotify and Pandora. Users are allowed to use the application to listen to music, but it is heavily restricted and supplemented by advertisements until users subscribe. Key Point: The **standard split is 70/30** (Apple takes 30% of app earnings, the developer takes 70%). But Apple now offers an **85/15 split for subscriptions** that last over a year (Ewan).

Pros

* People get to experience all of your app's features which increases session lengths and lowers app churn
* This app business model results in a continual weekly/monthly/yearly (depending on your setup) flow of revenue since subscriptions usually auto-renew
* Subscribers are more likely to be loyal and engaged app users
* Subscriptions and content gating also motivate app developers and app marketers to ensure they curate high-quality content that is worth paying for

Cons

* Does not easily translate to all verticals (most suited for news, lifestyle, and entertainment apps since they can limit content like articles read or videos watched)
* It can be hard to determine where and when to place a paywall (what is the right limit to place?)

The final revenue model is Sponsorship or Incentivized Advertising. Advertisers gain inclusion in the app by funding rewards for users, who earn these rewards by engaging more with your app.

Pros

* Innovative app business model which can be adapted for many verticals
* This advertising strategy will likely be better received by app users because it is relevant and related to an app's purpose
* App developers and marketers earn revenue, advertisers get more ad space, and users benefit from free promos
* This form of advertising can be aligned with your app's conversion funnels

Cons

* Mobile marketers need to be careful about what actions they incentivize within their app (Apple has been cracking down on incentivizing downloads and social sharing)
* This app business model has not been as thoroughly tried and tested as the other ones (results and success may vary)

## Monetizing the user database

A very viable mobile application monetization strategy not discussed in the six revenue models is monetizing the user database. This strategy is very useful and can be applied in combination with any of the other strategies. One reason is "higher CPM - on a per-user basis, the amount of revenue generated through data monetization is much higher than any other app monetization strategy" (Ewan). According to Investopedia, Cost per thousand (CPM) is a marketing term used to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions on one webpage. If a website publisher charges $2.00 CPM, that means an advertiser must pay $2.00 for every 1,000 impressions of its ad. The "M" in CPM represents the Roman numeral for 1,000\. Another reason is because monetizing data allows developers to monetize their entire audience without requiring the users to be inside of the application including users who have not used the application in a while. Possibly the most important benefit is that it protects the user experience without intrusive advertisements or unpleasant features allowing the audience to grow more quickly, leading to more revenue. One of the most effective ways to monetize user data is by utilizing "their precise location data from mobile apps to better understand consumer habits or behavior". Data monetization also occurs outside of the application meaning that the platform does not have access to those funds, and the benefits are not different depending on the platform.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1a2fb5a4-cb1f-4523-804b-4d757f5f1a92.png)

This statistic presents the most-used mobile app monetization models of mobile developers. In 2017, it was found that 49 percent of mobile app professionals implemented in-app advertising for non-gaming apps. Overall, 79 percent of gaming apps utilized in-app purchases of items ([Statista][1]).
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e1c35ada28fd730632bc9b73b6d84100fc1be81a.png)

A few general important topics that are essential to remember when monetizing a mobile application. The first is to protect the user experience at all costs. This can be accomplished by "keeping the user experience clean and ensure that app monetization does not damage the application experience. If you have to alter the experience in some way (ads etc), then manage this so that the impact is minimal." The second is to be actively involved in increasing the engagement of the users. The more time users spend on the application the higher the monetization. The third way essential to mobile application monetization is to continue to bring in new users which allows monetization to scale. This means it is necessary to "keep investing in user acquisition" because users will always "churn." Actively seeking new users is necessary (Ewan). Utilizing multiple monetization strategies is recommended (Ewan).

Using measuring techniques and analytics is necessary for successful monetization. Optimizing and adapting the monetization strategy will prolong success. Finding a monetization partner like Tamaco to help track analytics could prove useful. Using the information provided about mobile application revenue models an 8 part business model will follow describing a specific mobile application business venture (Ewan).

# Project FYI

The mobile application that we will be implementing is dubbed FYI. FYI will change the way people meet and interact by consolidating their information into a Virtual Identity Wallet. The Virtual Identity Wallet will transform an individual's multiple online identities and social media identities into one easily shareable FYI profile. Almost every individual in the modern world has multiple online identities. These commonly fall under social media profiles, but many other types of online identities exist. The issue of managing and sharing these accounts with others will continue to grow as these online identities continue to grow. May need to add something else to the app to keep users in the app or be more specific about how ads will be placed. The value proposition in the form of goals:

1. Consolidate any amount of an individual user's personal information and online identities into one virtual wallet known as an "FYI Profile".
2. Enable users to efficiently retrieve and connect with other user's online identities.
3. Provide an effective platform for users to share their "FYI Profiles" in the form of a mobile application.

### Revenue Model:

"The function of business organizations is both to generate profits and to produce returns on invested capital that exceed alternative investments" (Pearson 58). The revenue model of an application must be built into the vision of the application from it conception, but it may change over time. Application developers cannot get lost in the glamour of the mobile application market therefore it is essential to focus on a sustainable mobile application business. There are six primary revenue model strategies for mobile applications: In App Advertising, Freemium, Paid Apps, Purchases, Subscriptions/Paywalls, and Sponsorships. FYI will feature a hybrid monetization strategy that focuses on the user experience as the primary factor in decision making. The app experience trumps the app monetization. Maintaining a consistent and growing user database will, over time, increase monetization properly. This growth over time will allow us to grow the monetization strategy along with the users. The current monetization strategy will most likely change. The current vision of the application is to provide a utility. This method of application requires maximizing the efficiency of the applications user experience. With our application, high speed is very necessary. However the necessity of speed minimizes the amount of time our users will spend in the app. This results in a problem as the business model cannot support a paid application or in-app purchases (at this time).

Therefore, the first method of revenue generation is in-app advertisements. These must be very intuitive with the application's user flow as to not impede the user experience, and this may result in cancelling in-app advertisement from the current revenue model vision.

The second method of revenue generation is currently push notifications. Push notifications provide a way to implement advertisements. This also will provide a way to keep the users involved and must be part of our business model from the start. "Let's say your mobile app has 100,000 downloads. On average after just one day you can expect your audience retention rate to be around 20%. After ten days this figure drops to 7.5%. After ninety days this figure, for most mobile apps, falls to around 2%" ([Tamoco][2]). About 70% of users opt into push notifications and almost double app retention rates. Micro-moment push notifications based off of very detailed data collection will maximize this feature. Utilizing the company Tamoco as or revenue partner will be a strong possibility. They specialize in location based revenue generation, but will help with location based push notification. **Revenue generation via push notification advertisements may require a foundational switch in FYI's vision that will be required before initial marketing can commence.**_****_If the users believe this application is purely a utility application then they will be negatively impacted by push notifications that are not perfectly relevant to the utility functionality of the application. The current utility functionality does not support many push notifications at the current level of creative development. The foundationally shift will have to be from simply an application that aids in _Sharing Virtual Identities_, to an app that aids in the transaction of the virtual identities while supporting the amount of these interaction by supplementing location based recommendation on places and opportunities for these interactions. Pairing with other companies like Foursquare, Tinder, Bumble, who specialize in creating these types of opportunities and that are already built with the infrastructure to utilize their user database through location based targeted advertising will be a future endeavor.

Utilizing the user data to generate revenue will be the third method. There is a plethora of companies that are prying to access user information and monetize applications. The company business model is sound: people come to them with mobile application business ventures and if the company can monetize the individual's application, the company makes money off of other peoples ideas and efforts. There are companies like dawex.com that provide global data market places, companies like chooseapplovin.com, tappx.com that have complex algorithms to maximize the CPM of the advertisements in apps. Location based functionality is the most lucrative in monetizing user data. Tamoco is a company that partners with applications that provide geolocation about their users to generate revenue. Location functionality can be reasoned for mechanically because keeping track of where FYI collection events occur will support the user experience (See Functionality Document). Location functionality can now also be reasoned for to provide the user a better experience as FYI supplements the amount of opportunities users have to utilize the application to meet new people. Future developments to location functionality will support development of push notifications based upon the user's location in a targeted advertisement platform for FYI, that may even include a user interface for the targeted advertisement platform, similar to Foursquare's Pinpoint targeted advertisement platform. Foursquare's Attribution product "which mines daily location information of over 1.3 million Foursquare users who have consented to location tracking in order to determine whether or not the advertising they've seen has actually influenced their purchas- ing decisions" would be a possible direction to actually combining our user database's location preferences with a company that is already structured to monetize it (Pearson 61).

The fourth method to generate revenue will be with affiliate sponsorships. These will be connections that the management team makes with businesses in the areas that utilize the FYI application heavily. All the more reason user location services are necessary. Companies that would be interested in local advertising to a specific demographic we have access to. Since our initial target market is the very social college community at The University of South Carolina companies that would be interested would be food and beverage companies like the bars in the Five Points District, beverage companies, or college clothing companies. This sort of targeted advertising and affiliate sponsorship could prove very beneficial, but is not only dependent upon the success of the application's functionality but upon the management team's ability to make sales. A future functionality will be able to offer business's their own accounts as business constantly attempt to share their multiple social media accounts, and FYI would greatly increase the efficiency of this sharing.

### Market Opportunity

FYI's initial intended marketspace will be targeting 18-30-year-old college students, young professionals, and young adults. We believe this demographic to be one of the most valuable groups of influencers and spenders for most major corporations. Companies are willing to pay large fees to acquire the kind of data FYI will have. The applications for the use of this data is almost unfathomable. Every business from the "local bar" to Coca-Cola would do nearly anything for an accurate and organized database of young spenders in their area and/or product market. College students are constantly being pumped into USC and the management team has a strong influence. Our initial target market is almost a niche. Niche marketing has many benefits when it comes to e-commerce. These specifically apply to selling niche products, but the concept maintains (from [Ecomdash][3]):
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9677e394-c3d8-403f-861e-ba2ab6998ddf.png)

* Easier Marketing: When selling niche products, there is a defined customer and value proposition. Creating a marketing strategy for a target market is much simpler, cheaper, and more effective.
* Higher Search Engine Rankings: Unless you're a very well established website with an authoritative digital presence, your SEO strategy will be more effective if you focus on niche topics and long tail keywords. With this approach, you'll be more likely to reach your target audience, which means customers will have an easier time finding and buying your products.
* Lower Competition: Gaining a competitive advantage is a more straightforward process when selling niche products. With specific product offerings, a targeted audience, and a defined value proposition, you can focus on building a reputation as an expert in your field. It is easier to build trust and brand loyalty.

* Increased Chance of Success: Begin with a small, well-defined product range rather than casting a wide net. Selling a couple of niche products allows retailers to take the time needed to understand cost, pricing, and potential barriers to scaling sales. They can research their target audience and build a good marketing plan. With a focused marketing strategy, higher organic search rankings, and lower competition, niche retailers have the perfect recipe for a lucrative business. From there, they can then expand and diversify.

### Competitive Environment

About 10 hours of research (by two people) into the competitive environment of this application has been conducted, with very little results. FYI will be entering a space where competitors are concerned with the management of multiple social media platforms and not specifically the sharing and connecting of individuals. The specific card language in this instance does exist as a native contact known as "My Card" in iPhones, but it is functionally limited, not widely used, and not marketed as a distinct feature.

One example of similar technology does exist in the form of an outdated website known as DandyID. The technology is poorly designed and does not reach the appropriate market.

We have also done research into the intellectual property of this application as FYI is a common name.

* Domain​: FYI.tv Is an existing TV network, FYIApp.com is a real estate company up north, FYI.com is an available domain. FYI.app is coming out soon.
* Trademarks​: According to TESS only one FYI trademark exists in regards to mobile device software that was abandoned years ago.
* We have already started FYI App LLC.

### Market Strategy & Competitive Advantage

One of the biggest failures of strong early startups is exposure, and we understand that

FYI will only succeed if it provides a real utility that is put into the hands of enough users. It will be necessary for FYI to create a large user database, therefore the platform is designed to exponentially increase with each user account being connected to multiple other identities. The idea has not been implemented by competitors and we have a very strong grip on our initial target market because of [@DrinkingTicket][4] and our management team.

DrinkingTicket is a viral media account that has grown to be the most popular twitter

account in Columbia, SC. DrinkingTicket serves the purpose of assisting specifically the college student demographic. For Columbia, that demographic is the University of South Carolina. We tweet information about everything from DUI checkpoints to campus events to bar specials in 5 points (college bar district). We have become wildly popular with students generating on average in our more popular months 140,000 impressions a day and when school is out 69,000 impressions a day. DrinkingTicket has huge potential to be used as a marketing platform for monetization through sponsorship, advertising, and general demographic studies.

DrinkingTicket is a resource students in Columbia turn to for all of their most important information often times before even looking to traditional news sources or the University itself. DrinkingTicket has more student subscribers than the University's own emergency alert system. If we were to open a DrinkingTicket at every major school in the country we could harness the college demographic and push basically ANYTHING we want at them.

Local Events & Social Culture- FYI will have banners in a majority of the bars in Five Points. Every large school has a social culture and USC's is centric around The Five Points District. Alex Waelde is the operations manager and social media manager for 7 of the top bars in the district, opening doors to the entire area. We are able to directly reach large groups of affluent students with the interconnected communities throughout universities and the Greek Life culture. FYI will also have articles in newspapers and news stations, Post & Courier, The State, WIS10, WLTX, and WACHFox.

### Management Team

Alex Waelde a USC graduate. He is the operations manager and social media manager for 7 of the top bars in the five points district in Columbia, opening doors to the entire area. We are able to directly reach large groups of affluent students with the interconnected communities throughout universities and the Greek Life culture. Alex Waelde also has connecitons in newspapers and news stations, Post & Courier, The State, WIS10, WLTX, and WACHFox. Alex has guerrilla marketing Drinking Ticket to the status that it is today and has experience with startup of this nature. He had previously attempting a mobile application project 5 years ago that stalled as a result of the technical climate of the time and confusion among investors. Alex also worked a paralegal at one of the top law firms of South Carolina gaining a wealth of legal knowledge and collections. The 10 page development contract is now under review, pro bono, by these lawyers who normally charge $500/hr. Alex currently works at the largest corporate real estate firm in South Carolina, NAI Avant and has recently received his brokerage certification. This allows Alex to run the largest tailgate operation in the SEC. He manages 16 fraternities (2000 of the most influential men on campus) and an average of approximately 5,000 to 7,500 students per home tailgate. This provides tremendous penetration opportunity for FYI. Alex has also leveraged Drinking Ticket to become a master of all things Columbia, knowing the ins and out of almost every business in Columbia. FYI was the brainchild of Alex Waelde.

Ryan Roe will graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Systems and a minor in Business Information Management in May 2018\. This has allowed him to garner the technological knowledge and relationships necessary to take the technical lead on the FYI Project, specifically designing every functionality and fine tuning every piece of software developed for this application. Ryan has experience developing hybrid mobile applications with Typescript, HTML, and CSS. Ryan also specifically has experience developing with the front end platform FYI will be using, Ionic. The developer for the project is Steve Rubin ([steverubin.net][5]) and his company Melting Pot Solutions LLC (meltingpotsolutions.co). We have examined previous work by Steve and have chosen the hybrid mobile framework over native development because of decreased development costs beginning at 75% but up to 95% as well as a decrease in development time from 6 months to around 3 months. Hybrid development does come at a cost with slightly reduced functionality which entails the risk of the application not supporting future functionality that has not been defined at this point in planning. Hybrid development also risks being slightly slower than native development, but FYI is not a graphically or data heavy application and should not experience this setback. The specific functionality and a more detailed technical analysis can be found in the functionality document. Ryan also studies extensively the business of big data, monetizing mobile applications, analytics, e-commerce, and many more relevant technical topics necessary to be competitive in the current technological climate (ryanroe.io).

### Organizational Development

We understand that "many e-commerce firms and many traditional firms that attempt an e-commerce strategy have failed because they lacked the organizational structures and supportive cultural values required to support new forms of commerce (Pearson 65). We have planned for this, but not extensively. We have decided to form a 50-50 partnership with an extensive partnership agreement because we understand that disagreements among equal partners can be catastrophic for business and tend to happen. The partnership entails both parties owe 50% of the intial investment if the project fails and neither partner will benefit until the investment has paid back (unless it is necessary to make more money). The full partnership agreement will be disclosed in the weeks following beginning the development.

The rest of the organizational development will have to grow with the business. For now Alex Waelde is in primarily in charge of developing the legal agreements and developing and carrying out the marketing plan. Ryan Roe is in charge of overseeing the technical development and making sure that the app is positioned properly to take full advantage of all of its monetization capabilities. We will carry these jobs until new ones are created.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a business model is a set of planned activities designed to result in a profit in a marketplace and an e-commerce business model aims to use and leverage the unique qualities of the Internet, the Web, and the mobile platform to generate a profit. The 8 elements of the business model were explained in an attempt to lead towards a successful e-commerce business model: Value Proposition, Revenue Model, Market Opportunity, Competitive Environment, Competitive Advantage, Market Strategy, Organizational Development, and the Management Team. A study of statistics about the global climate of the mobile application economy found that mobile applications are still a very quickly growing source of revenue. Consumers have exceed spending $86 billion in 2017 up 105% from 2015\. Global application downloads exceeded 175 billion in 2017 up 60% from 2015 and users spend over 3 hours of their days in mobile applications. A business model was developed for the mobile application project, FYI, according to the 8 key elements: The value proposition was described, the revenue model was fleshed out with a monetization strategy that utilizes push notifications, monetizes the user data, and uses affiliate sponsorships. The competitive environment was assessed along with the competitive advantage and the market strategy. The management team was introduced and the organizational roles were defined. The mobile application economy is a booming market with plenty of opportunity, and FYI intends to take advantage of the opportunity.

With Love - Ryan Roe
