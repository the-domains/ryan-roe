This paper will utilize the book, _E-Commerce, _by Pearson Education to give a breakdown of the eight key elements to an e-commerce strategy as well as a definition for e-commerce. The definition of e-commerce is bolstered with an Elsevier Information and Management Journal article, "A Literature Review and Classification of Electronic Commerce Research" by Elizabeth Grandon. Statistical information on the global market of mobile applications is gathered from Statista & BusinessInsider then compiled by App Annie, a worldwide leader in mobile application analytics as well as BusinessofApps, Business of Apps provides app industry news, analysis, data & statistics for an audience of app and mobile professionals as well as an online marketplace for application development. App Annie's end of the year retrospective report for 2017 is also used to provide valuable current statistics on the mobile application economy. Mobile application specific revenue models are introduced by Localytics, an international mobile application analytics and marketing platform. Mobile application monetization is supplemented by a study from Tamoco, a website for precise location data for brands, apps, networks, and enterprise.

Section 2 -- Research Objective and Analysis

According to the book, E. Commerce, by Pearson Education, a business model is "a set of planned activities (sometimes referred to as business processes) designed to result in a profit in a marketplace" (Pearson 60). Developing an e-commerce strategy requires an e-commerce business model.According to Pearson, an e-commerce business model "aims to use and leverage the unique qualities of the Internet, the Web, and the mobile platform" to generate a profit. Similarly a business strategy is a "set of plans for achieving superior long-term returns on the capital invested in a business firm" (Pearson 91). As you can see a business model and a business strategy are two very similar topics, but a business strategy will get more specific on the tasks necessary to create the return. A company's business model consists of 8 key elements: value proposition, revenue model, market opportunity, competitive environment, competitive advantage, market strategy, organizational development, and management team.

The internet is replete with articles discussing a successful e-commerce strategy because these strategies are so specific, how does one develop a competitive business strategy without a specific example? Let's examine each of the 8 elements of the business model. The two most noticeable elements are the value proposition and the revenue model. Why will a customer conduct business with a particular company over another? The answer to that question is the company's value proposition, which "defines how a company's product or service fulfills the needs of customers" (57). The company's value proposition is the heart and soul of the business idea, and choosing a businesses' idea is very important and should be based upon market research and be tied into the other 7 key business model elements. The next element is the revenue model which is just as it sounds: how a company is going to generate a return upon the investment. Many types of e-commerce revenue models exist: advertising revenue model, subscription revenue model, freemium strategy, transaction fee revenue model, sales revenue model, and the affiliate revenue model, and a proper understanding to each of them is necessary for selection.

The next element of an e-commerce business model is its intended market space or potential market share. That market share will further be broken up into smaller niches, especially in the e-commerce climate. "The realistic market opportunity is defined by the revenue potential in each of the market niches where you hope to compete" (62). Having an understanding of the potential market opportunities will prove useful in selecting a value proposition and for the success of the business. The internet has enabled millions of different small niches that are ripe for the picking, so that would be a great direction because attempting to compete with huge companies maintaining large market shares is nearly impossible for small businesses. Ecomdash is a successful online SaaS company that sells Multichannel Inventory Control Software for e-commerce sellers. They state that niche market products are easier to market, have higher search engine rankings, have less competition and therefore a higher chance of success (Ecomdash 1).

Competitive environment marks the fourth key element to an e-commerce business strategy. "A firm's competitive environment refers to the other companies selling similar products and operating in the same marketspace. It also refers to the presence of substitute products and potential new entrants to the market, as well as the power of customers and suppliers over your business" (Pearson 62). When weighing in options in regard to the competitive environment one must consider how many competitors are active, what the market share of each competitor is, how profitable these firms are, and how they price their products to name a few. Markets will have direct competitors who sell very similar products and indirect competitors who sell substitute products. One must be aware of the existence of too many competitors resulting a saturated market and greater difficulty in generating a profit.

The fifth key element to e-commerce is creating a competitive advantage in your market. According to Pearson a competitive advantage is "achieved by a firm when it can produce a superior product and/or bring the product to market at a lower price than most, or all, of its competitors" (63). Pearson sums up the ways that an e-commerce business can achieve an advantage:

* Firms achieve a competitive advantage when they can produce a superior product and/or bring the product to market at a lower price than most, or all, of their competitors (Porter, 1985).
* Firms also compete on scope. Some firms can develop global markets, while other firms can develop only a national or regional market. Firms that can provide superior products at the lowest cost on a global basis are truly advantaged.
* Firms achieve competitive advantages because they have somehow been able to obtain differential access to the factors of production that are denied to their competitors---at least in the short term (Barney, 1991).
* A first-mover advantage is a competitive market advantage for a firm that results from being the first into a marketplace with a serviceable product or service. This lacks complementary resources, so it is risky.

It does not matter how great a company or product is if they do not have a sound marketing strategy. The sixth key element of a business model can cripple a project before it even starts. This strategy refers to the plan that details exactly how the firm "intends to enter a new market and attract new customers" (Pearson 65). Some common marketing strategies for e-commerce ventures are (Walker):

1. Compose an executive summary
2. Identify your goals and objectives
3. Craft a mission statement and value proposition
4. Target the right customers and market(s)
5. Conduct a situational analysis
6. Develop a pricing and positioning strategy
7. Optimize your distribution and fulfillment plan
8. Create a cross-channel promotion plan
9. Inventory existing marketing assets
10. Construct a conversion strategy
11. Explore joint ventures and partnerships
12. Detail a strategy for increasing orders
13. Deploy a referral strategy
14. Outline financial projections

Many new entrepreneurial e-commerce ventures begin with one individual and slowly grow over time. Planning for this growth is the seventh key element to the e-commerce business model. This is known as Organizational Development. The company must have a plan to organize the work that needs to be accomplished. "Typically, work is divided into functional departments, such as production, shipping, marketing, customer support, and finance" (Pearson 65). At the beginning of a venture, the same person will be doing multiple of the jobs required for each department. However, as the company grows more and more people will be hired. Eventually each department will be broken down and multiple people will be handling each department.

Pearson considers the final element to be the most important part of the e-commerce business model, the Management Team. This is the people running the idea. This is the people making the project succeed. "A strong management team gives a model instant credibility to outside investors, immediate market-specific knowledge, and experience in implementing business plans." The managers of a project themselves can be the source of a competitive advantage that helps a project succeed. They may not be able to "salvage a weak business model, but the team should be able to change the model and redefine the business as it becomes necessary (Pearson 66).

The definitive scope of e-commerce has grown exponentially in the past decade and there is no exhaustive definition as the topic continues to transform and grow. Multiple definitions are required. The traditional view of e-commerce is simply an online store, or "the process of buying and selling products or services using electronic data transmission via the Internet and the www" (Grandon). Pearson gives a more general description by saying that e-commerce is "the use of the Internet, the Web, and mobile apps and browsers running on mobile devices to transact business. More formally, digitally enabled commercial transactions between and among organizations and individual." A literature review conducted in 2002 of over 270 academic journals defines e-commerce based on four perspectives (Ngai):

* From a communications perspective, e-commerce is the delivery of information, products/services, or payments via telephone lines, computer networks, or any other means.
* From a business process perspective, e-commerce is the application of technology toward the automation of business transactions and workflow.
* From a service perspective, e-commerce is a tool that addresses the desire of firms, consumers, and management to cut service costs while improving the quality of goods and increasing the speed of service delivery.
* From an online perspective, e-commerce provides the capability of buying and selling products and information on the Internet and other online services.

For this paper we will not be focusing on a traditional online store that buys and sells goods but on e-commerce from a communications and service perspective. The business model that will be developed is for a mobile application that delivers information as a service that addresses the desires of consumers. The development of the business model will follow the eight key elements described earlier. This business model will be implemented in reality as a business venture. The results of the study (success or failure) may be released at the end of Fall 2018\.

A study on the world of global applications proves beneficial to answer the question, why choose a mobile application platform when they may be known to be notoriously difficult to monetize.

## **Key App Revenue Statistics**:

* Global mobile app revenue in 2016 -- $88 billion
* Global mobile app revenue forecast for 2020 -- $189 billion
* Global Paid-for mobile app revenues in 2017 -- $29 billion
* Worldwide In-app purchase revenues in 2017 -- $37 billion
* US mobile app advertising revenues in 2017 -- $33 billion
* Top Grossing iOS app in 2017 -- Pokemon GO (over $2 billion)

In 2015 the total revenue generated across all mobile operating systems was about $70 billion, in 2016 this number reached $88 billion. By 2020 the combined mobile app revenue will reach a staggering $189 billion (Fig 2). Gradually, year-over-year in-app purchases began to take over other monetization models and by 2017 way over 50% a mobile app revenue is generated via in-app purchases (Fig 3). There is a growing trend that mobile app users do not download new apps as much as they used to and regularly utilize the same applications. In 2011, two years after in-app purchase were introduced, until 2017 revenue went up from $7 billion in 2011 to $29 billion in 2017, but starting in 2015, there is a clear stalling in paid-for application growth, which can be attributed to the mobile app ecosystem maturity (Fig 4). In 2011 in-app purchases generated $712 million, but by 2017 in-app purchases generated $37 billion which beats paid for apps by $8 billion (Fig 5, Dogtiev, Statista).

To find new revenue, developers began advertising inside of applications. "There are four major genres of mobile ads -- Display, Search, Social and Video." Search advertisements has been the primary competitor. The distribution is in Figure 6 (BusinessInsider). The iOS App Store has proven to be more lucrative than Google's Android because of Apple's walled garden approach combined with top notch hardware, software, and brand recognition. In 2017 Apple's iOS generated $40 billion, Google Play $21 billion and third-party stores generated $20 billion (Fig 7). If application revenue is separated by category of app, gaming is by far the leader. In 2017 mobile gaming revenue claimed 49% of total revenue while the other 19 categories claimed the other 51% (Fig 8). The top grossing mobile apps were Pokemon GO with over $2 billion, Candy Crush Saga -- over $1.5 billion and Clash Royale about $1.2 billion (Fig 9). The top non-game revenue can be seen in Figure 10 (Dogtiev). One of the best ways to understand the effectiveness of an application is to measure the monthly retention. "Since 2016, average one month, two month and three month retention has increased by 11%, 22% and 28% respectively, which equates to an average increase of 20% across the board. Additionally, monthly churn, or people who do not return to an app, has decreased by an average of 7%" (Localytics, Fig 11). This could prove disheartening to new application developers, but the data shows that users have a strong appetite for applications: "In most markets analyzed, the average smartphone user has more than 80 apps on their phone and uses close to 40 of them each month. This roughly equates to between one-third and one-half of the apps on users' phones used each month on average" (App Annie, Fig 12). Monetization in the top markets continued their steep growth (Fig 13). Consumers have exceed spending $86 billion in 2017 which is up 105% from 2015 (Fig 14). Global application downloads exceeded 175 billion in 2017 which is up 60% from 2015 and users spend over 3 hours of their days in mobile applications (Fig 15, Fig 16).

Six common revenue models for mobile applications exist (Munir). The first is a free download, but with in-app advertising.Revenue is derived from selling data-driven advertising space in the application. The develops can find advertisers independently or work with partners that provide the advertisements for them. Common examples are social media applications like Facebook. There are a few different types of in-app advertisements. Banner ads were the original are the original in-app advertisement but quickly faded out because of extremely negatively impacting the user's experience. The second type is Interstitial Ads which came about because developers wanted an alternative to banner ads. One potential solution to this problem of how intrusive banners ads were "was to take the same ads and show them as a full-screen ad to the user. This occurs between separate user flows." Not ruining the user experiences requires a strong knowledge of the applications user flow. The third type of in-app advertising is native ads. Native advertisement integrate seamlessly into the look and design of the application. A common example is ads in the Facebook timeline. Native ads have a higher engagement rate, but is it tricking the user into clicking the ad? "The key is to make the native ad look and feel 'native' whilst also providing a clear indication to the user that the content they will land on is an advert." The fourth type of in-app advertisement is affiliate advertisements. Affiliate advertisements garner commission from other products. Affiliate advertisement work by recommending the advertisement based upon the users experiences and trust of the current application. The final example is reward advertisements which offer users incentive to use the app, but provide rewarding deals and advertisements if they engage with content. Another possibility for advertising is to utilize push notifications.

Pros

* Mobile apps are in a prime position to collect tons of data on their users (such as their in-app behavior and their location)
* Allows you to gain users quickly because people love free apps
* Can be effective if moderate and targeted advertising is used (ads are interesting yet limited)

Cons

* Not an innovative model and people can get annoyed of ads, which may lead to app churn
* Mobile ads can comprise your app experience by claiming a portion of the already limited screen size
* This model won't work for niche or utility apps that are designed to help users perform important functions (ads will be too unnatural and intrusive in this setting when people just want to do something quickly)

The second mobile application revenue model is Freemium. With this strategy users are allowed a free download, but are only able to use a portion of the app's functionality. Once users are committed, then they are willing to purchase the extra features. A common application of this category is Angry Birds.

Pros

* This mobile business model makes it easy to build up a large user base and showcases your app so people get attached then upsell
* People who "try before they buy" are more likely to become engaged and loyal users later on
* Flexible model because it can be adapted to almost any vertical

Cons

* If you offer too few features for free, app churn will be high
* If you offer too many features for free, it will be difficult/complex to convince your existing user base to pay for an upgrade (upgrade won't have much incremental value)
* App marketers must be careful not to provide a large segment of their users (the free ones) with an inferior app experience

The third mobile application revenue model is paid apps. Users must purchase the application before they use the application. The application must have superior marketing and the ability to convince users to buy instead of use free substitutes.

Pros

* App developers and app marketers earn revenue upfront with every new download
* People who have paid for an app are more likely to turn into engaged users (since they spent money to purchase your app vs. choosing a free one)
* In this model, the app does not usually have any in-app advertising thus allowing it to have a cleaner interface
* This model motivates app developers to focus on innovation since people expect paid apps to be the crème of the crop

Cons

* Selling an app is difficult because app stores are so overcrowded (stiff competition from many free apps)
* App stores take a cut of the revenue from paid apps (Apple gets approximately 30%)
* Paid models are a shrinking part of app store revenue
* 90% of paid apps are downloaded less than 500 times per day (cost-barrier to gaining a large number of users)

The fourth strategy to monetize mobile applications is In-App Purchases (Selling Physical/Virtual Goods). This model constitutes two different ideas. The first is creating a sales channel for real world purchases. The second is creating a mobile storefront for virtual good that are used within the application. "Apple and Google both take 30% of every in-app purchase through your app" (Ewan). Transaction fees play a part in this model as well. For applications that create user marketplaces, fees can be deducted from both parties. A new form of application has begun taking form of financial transaction applications where developers can institute a fee as well.

Pros

* This app business model works particularly well for eCommerce/mCommerce brands and is flexible enough for other verticals too
* In-app purchases can help app marketers make comfortable profits with the lowest amount of risk
* Buying virtual goods can lead to deeper levels of engagement (growing monetization strategy)
* The profit margin is usually high with this model because brands don't have the traditional expenses on mobile that brick-and-mortar stores do (like staffing and rent)
* Flexible model which can also be adapted to include affiliate programs and partnerships that drive referral revenue

Cons

* App stores usually take a cut of the revenue for virtual goods (but not physical goods or services) purchased inside an app
* Recently, this model has received bad publicity because government officials are pressuring Apple and Google to add stricter regulations to prevent children from making accidental in-app purchases
* Apps will need to be more transparent on their app store listing page if they include in-app purchases (which may prevent some people from downloading)

The fifth form of mobile application monetization is Subscriptions. Users are sometimes allowed to access a limited amount of data or services and sometimes they must subscribe to access any data. A common application of this model is Spotify and Pandora. Users are allowed to use the application to listen to music, but it is heavily restricted and supplemented by advertisements until users subscribe. Key Point: The **standard split is 70/30** (Apple takes 30% of app earnings, the developer takes 70%). But Apple now offers an **85/15 split for subscriptions** that last over a year (Ewan).

Pros

* People get to experience all of your app's features which increases session lengths and lowers app churn
* This app business model results in a continual weekly/monthly/yearly (depending on your setup) flow of revenue since subscriptions usually auto-renew
* Subscribers are more likely to be loyal and engaged app users
* Subscriptions and content gating also motivate app developers and app marketers to ensure they curate high-quality content that is worth paying for

Cons

* Does not easily translate to all verticals (most suited for news, lifestyle, and entertainment apps since they can limit content like articles read or videos watched)
* It can be hard to determine where and when to place a paywall (what is the right limit to place?)

The final revenue model is Sponsorship or Incentivized Advertising. Advertisers gain inclusion in the app by funding rewards for users, who earn these rewards by engaging more with your app.

Pros

* Innovative app business model which can be adapted for many verticals
* This advertising strategy will likely be better received by app users because it is relevant and related to an app's purpose
* App developers and marketers earn revenue, advertisers get more ad space, and users benefit from free promos
* This form of advertising can be aligned with your app's conversion funnels

Cons

* Mobile marketers need to be careful about what actions they incentivize within their app (Apple has been cracking down on incentivizing downloads and social sharing)
* This app business model has not been as thoroughly tried and tested as the other ones (results and success may vary)

A very viable mobile application monetization strategy not discussed in the six revenue models is monetizing the user database. This strategy is very useful and can be applied in combination with any of the other strategies. One reason is "higher CPM - on a per-user basis, the amount of revenue generated through data monetization is much higher than any other app monetization strategy" (Ewan). According to Investopedia, Cost per thousand (CPM) is a marketing term used to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions on one webpage. If a website publisher charges $2.00 CPM, that means an advertiser must pay $2.00 for every 1,000 impressions of its ad. The "M" in CPM represents the Roman numeral for 1,000\. Another reason is because monetizing data allows developers to monetize their entire audience without requiring the users to be inside of the application including users who have not used the application in a while. Possibly the most important benefit is that it protects the user experience without intrusive advertisements or unpleasant features allowing the audience to grow more quickly, leading to more revenue. One of the most effective ways to monetize user data is by utilizing "their precise location data from mobile apps to better understand consumer habits or behavior". Data monetization also occurs outside of the application meaning that the platform does not have access to those funds, and the benefits are not different depending on the platform.
