The extended research paper will discuss an analysis of e-commerce
strategies for a new organization. The research paper begins to
outline a successful e-commerce strategy by looking at the components
of common e-commerce strategies that use technology as an advantage.
A definition of e-commerce will then be defined and chosen to be
utilized throughout the paper. The scope will be further honed to a
focus on Mobile E-Commerce strategies. The global mobile application
market will be studied in detail to provide a background for research
on developing a mobile application e-commerce strategy. The paper
will utilize this information to show that mobile applications are
monetizable and to develop a very specific mobile application
business model that will be tested. Every aspect of the mobile
application's business model will be defined according to eight key
elements of an e-commerce business model. The testing of the mobile
application e-commerce business model example will begin the Fall of
2018, dubbed FYI.
