Coaxial cable

* Two conductive materials centered around center axis
* Radio Grade rating ex: RG8
* Impedance rating ex: 50 ohms
* Types of Coaxial:
* Thick or RG8, 50 ohms
* Thin or RG58, 50 ohms
* BNC connecter (Bob Nancy Charley & T connector cuz before switches)
* Common Cable Box Coaxial RG6, 70 Ohm with F-Connector

UTP and STP Cabling

* Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
* Predominate cabling
* Vulnerable to interference but Reduces interference by pair
* Usually has 4 pairs
* Has Kevlar so you can pull it
* Improvements to this cable over the years known as Categories or Cat levels
* Cat 3: 10 Mb/sec
* Cat 5e: 100 Mb/sec
* Cat 6: 1000 Mb/sec
* Cat 6a: 10 Gb/sec
* Affected by electric motors or flourescent lights
* Not used by BNC connectors??
* Shielded twisted pair
* Aluminum foil shielding

Fiber Optics

* Physical Make Up
* Core which carries light
* Cladding which light reflects off of when staying in fiber itself
* Jacket
* Two Types
* Multimode
* Designed to propagate light
* **LED** lights up to propagate light down cable
* Orange (aqua = special type)
* Single Mode
* Designed to be used with **lasers**, thinner
* longer distances
* Yellow
* Always use two **Connectors** at time (Duplex), Many types of Connectors:
* Old (Duplex)
* ST connector: earliest types, round connector, punch in and twist
* SC connector: square, punch in and pull out, no twist
* FC connector: screws in like coaxial, not twist
* New aka High Density (combined duplex into one)
* LC connector: two combined into one but still noticeably
* MT-RJ connector: even smaller
* Polishing (how the light is transferred at the end of the cables)
* PC (Polished connector): flat end
* UPC (Ultra Polished Connector): rounded end
* APC (Angled Polished Connector): angled cut off end
* Best connection but substantially more difficult and expensive

Quiz 2

1. UTP does not use BNC connectors
2. RG-58 uses T-connectors and terminators
3. Know the CAT ratings
4. Know all of the types of fiber optic connectors
