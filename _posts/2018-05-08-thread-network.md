  Image: Partial map of the Internet based on the January 15, 2005 data found on
  opte.org. Each line is drawn between two nodes, representing two IP addresses.
  The length of the lines are indicative of the delay between those two nodes.
  This graph represents less than 30% of the Class C networks reachable by the
  data collection program in early 2005. Lines are color-coded according to
  their corresponding RFC 1918allocation as follows: Dark blue: net, ca, us
