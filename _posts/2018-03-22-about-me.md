I am a Charleston native and intend to live there for the rest of my life.

Currently working at Blackbaud, Inc as a Client Account Executive (CAE). In my first role at Blackbaud, Inc (my first sales role and first job out of college) I was an Associate Account Executive in the Emerging Core space. I supported a more experienced CAE as the primary point of contact for over 700 different nonprofits with contributions under $1M. I excelled in this role, and alongside a restructuring of the sales department in Q1 of 2019 was promoted to a position as a Client Account Executive in the K-12 Vertical after 4 months in seat. In this role I maintained my own 200 accounts, schools under 300 students that had our Smart Tuition Products. Success tbd...

I graduated from The University of South Carolina (USC) 2018 which developed my skills and experiences in two seemingly opposite directions.

The first area of growth is relationally as a manager of large scale social projects. I chartered a Social Philanthropy fraternity, Theta Chi, as a freshman with only 30 other people. Over the years I have taken the lead in almost every project whether it be social, organizational, institutional, philanthropic, or political as Vice President. The organization now maintains over 120 members. The connections and experience I gained awarded me an interview with the previous Student Body President, Ross Lordo, for a position on his cabinet as Director of Cockstock. Cockstock is USC's name for a free homecoming concert built using a $100,000 conglomeration of 5 different student organization's budgets. I was tasked with overseeing budget spending and coordinating these organizations, each consisting of their own bureaucracy to create successful event. Planning a concert of this size is not difficult: quote multiple venues, talent agencies, production companies, and security companies, poll the students, set up ticket sales, hire graphic designers, and then market through the appropriate channels. I utilized posters, stickers, tabling, talked alone in front of sorority meetings (200+ people), and utilized social media, particularly my friend's account, Drinking Ticket. The difficult piece of Cockstock was politically extracting $100,000 from a state funded public university's representatives as an undergraduate student. The Cockstock program is only in its second year, and this project required over 8 months of my time constantly meeting, calling, and coordinating. An unsuccessful event, high cost per head, would result in the cancellation of the budget allotment and the end of the program. The venue sold out at 10,000 people and I successfully planned the largest student run event at The University of South Carolina to date.

The second area of growth is technically as a student of Computer Science. Degrees in Computer Science teach students very little in the current academic climate and most knowledge is self-taught. The value in the degree comes with a general overview of the available technologies, a few projects, and the community I was introduced to. I have designed programs in Java, C++, TypeScript/CSS/HTML. I have built relational databased using SQL and constructed COBOL databases on IBM mainframes through an ISPF Unix Distribution, tn 3270x. I have garnered a tremendous interest in Linux and Hybrid Mobile Application Development technology. I have concluded developing a mobile application, Beacon and have began contracting a revolutionary social technology in the form of a hybrid mobile app dubbed FYI. I am also creating an online e-commerce solutions company and currently have 3 clients. This website is my technology project that grows along with me, where I showcase my fascination with the many aspects of technology. The blog posts focus on the history of technology, hybrid mobile application technology, the current climate of monetizing mobile applications, and breaking down complex technical subjects for easy introduction (sometimes deceptively verbose): specifically cryptocurrency, e-commerce, reprogrammable computing, Big Data (one of my favorites), and much more.
