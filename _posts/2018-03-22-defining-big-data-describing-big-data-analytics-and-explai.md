## Section 1 -- Introduction with Review of Literature

This paper provides a concise overview of the broader concepts of big data and how it impacts the modern economic society, particularly in America. In an examination of the rise of big data, an attempt is made to further hone the definition of what constitutes big data, and its associated characteristics. The paper then focuses on how big data is utilized, with examples of common analytical tools. An understanding of big data's impact on the modern economy follows, using examples from specific companies leading the industry. The paper concludes with an examination of the positive and negative issues that arise in the economic community as a result of harnessing big data.

This paper utilizes a 2015 publication from The International Conference on Integrated Information, titled "What is big data? A consensual definition and a review of key research topics" to provide attempts at a common definition and an analysis of the term, big data, by synthesizing common themes of existing works and patterns in previous definitions, as well as to "provide a summary of the key research areas related to the phenomenon, identifying emerging trends and suggesting opportunities for future development." A 2016 article released on enterprisetech.com by managing editor, Doug Black, titled, "The 'Insight-Driven Business': How to Become a Master of the Data Universe" is used to harp on the distance between big data and actual analytics as well as provide insights on businesses who efficiently utilize this, "digital insight." This paper also uses a 2015 issue from The International Journal of Information Management titled, "Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics" to expand the discussion on the definition of big data with an understanding that it is "contextualized in predictive analytics frameworks," to discuss how "analytics have captured the imaginations of business and government leaders and describe the state-of-practice of a rapidly evolving industry," highlight the perils of big data, and discover "expected developments in the near future of big data analytics." The Pearson Education publication, "E-Commerce", is used to provide multiple case studies of companies, and provide overviews of big data analytics and predictive marketing. This paper intends to synthesize the findings of these publications as well as 4 online articles and 6 more scholarly journal postings to efficiently discuss big data and analytics impact on e-commerce.

## Section 2 -- Research Objective and Analysis

What is big data? While the term, big data, is a ubiquitous buzzword today, the origins are uncertain and according to a PIER Working Paper by Diebold, Francis X, probably began in the mid 1990's at lunch-table conversations at Silicon Graphics Inc, "in which John Mashey figured prominently". The term became widespread around 2011 as a result of the promotional initiatives headed by leading technology companies like IBM investing in "building the niche analytics market" (Gandomi 138, Fig. 1). The meaning is much more complex and is still "shrouded by much conceptual vagueness." The scientific world has not precisely agreed upon one definition, but the term refers to "a wide range of concepts: from the technological ability to store, aggregate, and process data, to the cultural shift that is pervasively invading business and society, both drowning in information overload (De Mauro 2)." These multiple definitions can be seen from an online survey of 154 C-suite global executives conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of SAP in April 2012 (Gandomi 138, Fig. 2) This gives rise to the first issue apparent with big data. Not having a clear definition "poses a threat to the structured evolution" of the field of study (De Mauro 2). Pearson's E-Commerce puts it simply, "Big data refers to the deluge of digital data that is being produced by the billions of people using the Internet, smartphones, and smartphones around the world, as well as an explosion of data from the Internet of Things" (Pearson 615).

In 2013 according to IBM's Consumer Products Industry Blog 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day, but according to Vishal Kumar, Ceo of Cognizeous and Coauthor of "Data Driven Innovation: A Primer" in 2020 about 1.7 megabytes of new information will be created every second for every human being on the planet. The statistics of the amount of stored information involved in the field of big data are truly staggering. More data has been created in the past two years than in the entire history of the human race, but what makes up this data?

According to IBM, big data can be classified with the four V's: Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Veracity. Volume refers to the magnitude of the data which is commonly reported on in terabytes and petabytes, but definitions of big data volumes are relative and vary by factors such as time and the type of data, which leads to variety. Variety "refers to the structural heterogeneity in a data set." Technological advances have developed various types of structured (tabular data, spreadsheet, numerical), semi-structured (XML), and unstructured data (text, images, audio, video). Structured data only constitutes 5% of all existing data (Cukier, 2010). Velocity refers to "the rate at which data are generated and the speed at which it should be analyzed and acted upon." With the tremendous rise of digital devices this industry has a growing need for "real time analytics and evidence based planning". Veracity "represents the unreliability inherent in some sources of data, which is addressed using tools and analytics developed for management and mining of uncertain data". Beyond the original four V's are Variability and Value. Variability (combined with Complexity) developed by SAS, refers to the variation in the data flow rates, Complexity refers to the "fact that big data are generated through a myriad of sources. This imposes a critical challenge: the need to connect, match, clean, and transform data received from different sources." The final attribute of big data, Value, introduced by Oracle states that big data are often characterized by relatively "low value "density in comparison to its volume, but a "high value can be obtained by analyzing large volumes of such data" (Gandomi 138-139).

How can all of this data be used? There exists a clear disconnect between the amount of information being gathered and how much is being utilized. Kumarsays that, "at the moment less than 0.5% of all data is ever analyzed and used." In Doug Black's Enterprisetech article, the relative amount of unstructured (currently unusable) data to structured (usable) data creates a large disconnect. He envisions the "enterprise tech landscape as a data lakes district" filled with dead pools. A problem exists in the disconnect between amount of data available and the ability to utilize or add value to the data. As Forrester Research's Brian Hopkins, vice president and principal analyst, observes, that the critical issue is viewing analytics through a "strategic prism that distinguishes data from action" or that there is a wide gulf between big data and actual analytics. "The first step is to embrace a concept what Hopkins calls "digital insight," the ability 'to systematically harness and apply digital insights to create a sustainable competitive advantage.' The second step is to understand how Insight Driven businesses operate. Hopkins Hopkins says he has interviewed hundreds of 'digital disrupters,' ranging from the monsters (Netflix, et. al) to start-ups 'trying to figure out what it is they're doing differently.'" "Common among them is the circular and continual use/re-use of data within a closed loop system", where each closed loop operates faster than their competitor (Black).

Big data's potential value is unleashed when it is "leveraged to drive decision making in real time" which requires "efficient processes to turn high volumes of fast moving and diverse data into meaningful insights" (Gandomi 140). Gandomi expresses that, the overall process of utilizing big data can be explained in five stages (Labrinidis &Jagadish, 2012), shown in Fig. 3\. The first main process is Data Management which involves processes and supporting technologies to acquire and store data and to prepare and retrieve it for analysis. These processes are Acquisition and Recording, Extraction Cleaning and Annotation, and Integration Aggregation and Representation. The second main process is Analytics, which "refers to techniques used to analyze and acquire intelligence from big data." Analytics, according to Labrinidis & Jagadish, consists of Modeling and Analysis, and finally, Interpretation. "Thus, big data analytics can be viewed as a sub-process in the overall process of 'insight extraction' from big data" (Gandomi 140).

The successful analysis of big data for decision making requires innovative and advanced processing methods which require advanced skills that are scarce in the modern economy. In De Mauro, Greco, and Grimaldi's publication, "What is Big Data? A Consensual Definition and a Review of Key Research Topics" a list of Big Data Analytical Methods is proposed, that includes: A/B testing, Association rule learning, Classification, Cluster analysis, Data fusion and data integration, Ensemble learning, Genetic algorithms, Machine learning, Natural Language Processing, Neural networks, Network analysis, Pattern recognition, Predictive modelling, Regression, Sentiment Analysis, Signal Processing, Spatial analysis, Statistics, Supervised and Unsupervised learning, Simulation, Time series analysis and Visualization (Manyika, Chen). Further examples are discussed in Amir Gandomi and Murtaza Haider's "Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics" in the International Journal of Information Management:

* Text Analytics: Information Extraction, Text Summarization, Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis (Opinion Mining)
* Audio Analytics: Speech Analytics, Transcript-based approaches, and phonetic-based approaches
* Video Analytics: Facial Recognition, Behavioral studies, Automatic Video Indexing, Video Indexing through System Architecture techniques such as: Server-Based Architecture and Edge-Based Architecture
* Social Media Analytics: Content-based, Structure-based, Community Detection, Social Influence Analysis
* Predictive Analysis

## Section 3 -- Results

The extent to which big data is impacting our society and our companies is often depicted through anecdotes" accompanied by new principles and methodological improvements (De Mauro 100)." Foursquare is recommendation service primarily used in mobile devices which has over 55 million monthly active users, and it tracks their every move automatically through smartphone-based technology. This is an example of the extraordinary value that consumer and location based data has for targeted advertising. Foursquare developed a separate app Swarm which absorbed Foursquare's check in feature. Swarm learns about user's tastes from over 10,000 possibilities to provide recommendations, but this also provides massive amount of data that is usable by the company. Consequentially the company developed Pinpoint, "an advertising tool that allows marketers unprecedented ability to target users based on its accumulated historical location data and to filter out inaccurate data." Foursquare has since stuck deals with "Twitter, Google, Yahoo, and Pinterest to provide location-based functions and to share location data, increasing the richness and accuracy of its own data in the process."

This example is mirrored by any other modern technology in which users provide information about themselves Google or any search engine, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or any other social media, any recommendation app like Groupon, Yelp, or even any application that tracks geographical data. The introduction of big data has created an entire new category of business. This process is happening whether we know it or not, in 2016 Foursquare released "its Attribution product, which mines daily location information of over 1.3 million Foursquare users who have consented to location tracking in order to determine whether or not the advertising they've seen has actually influenced their purchasing decisions" (Pearson 60-61).

This idea is not very new, but it just now becoming widespread and technologically available. The journal "Data Mining with Big Data" by Xindong Wu, Xingquan Zhu, Gong-Qing Wu, Wei Ding published in IEEE Transaction on Knowledge and Data Engineering discusses the history of this technology. "Major business intelligence companies, such IBM, Oracle, Teradata, and so on, have all featured their own products to help customers acquire and organize these diverse data sources and coordinate with customers' existing data to find new insights and capitalize on hidden relationships." This technology used to be limited without the support of a large amount of support. It is put well when they say, "Such a Big Data system, which blends both hardware and software components, is hardly available without key industrial stockholders' support. In fact, for decades, companies have been making business decisions based on transactional data stored in relational databases. Big Data mining offers opportunities to go beyond traditional relational databases to rely on less structured data: weblogs, social media, e-mail, sensors, and photographs that can be mined for useful information" (Wu 100).

Big Data is intertwined with the modern economy and its impact upon society is both beneficial and adverse. Privacy is a growing concern with quick growth of big data. Most applications do not have a privacy policy and the popularity of location-based services has skyrocketed. The information is transmitted directly to the developers and is not protected properly creating a "situation where government, marketers, creditors, and telecommunications firms will end up knowing nearly everything about citizens, including their whereabouts." "A 2016 study indicated that algorithms that analyze Twitter posts in tandem with Foursquare or Instagram posts can identify users' identities with relative ease. One advantage Foursquare does have, though, is that many of its users are actually interested in having their location racked and their data collected" (Pearson 61). Issues also arise with the accessibility of information exclusively available to large companies creating a strong unfair advantage (De Mauro 100).

## Section 4 -- Conclusion

In this paper, we have provided a concise overview of big data, analytics, and their impact on the modern e-commerce. We have cleared the ambiguity of the definition of big data to be "Information assets characterized by such a High Volume, Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value" (De Mauro 103, Table 1). The paper has discussed how analytics plays a role in big data and how big data can be harnessed to create value. This value has been shown through examples at specific companies which further defines big data's impact up on e-commerce. The topic of big data deserves much more research as the scope of this paper was intended to provide a general and quick overview of the industry of big data and associated topics.

* Possible extensions to this work could include:
* Further dissemination of the definition of big data
* Further describe the types of data that constitute big data
* How to lessen the gap between utilizable and unitilizable data
* More modern statistic on big data
* Increase the specific examples of the utilization of big data
* Information upon the skills that would prove oneself valuable in this industry
* A study of common technologies developed that utilize big data analytics
* Examples of how a small application can provide detailed analytical data and which companies will purchase this data
