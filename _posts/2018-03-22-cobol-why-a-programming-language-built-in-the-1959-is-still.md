# COBOL: Why a programming language built in 1959 should still be taught.

Thread: An Introduction to Difficult Tech Concepts

## Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL). What is it? What was its purpose? Who still uses it? Why do they still use it? And an interview with a software engineer hired to develop a program to convert a COBOL database to SQL.

COBOL is an English based programming language designed in 1959 for use in business and more specifically, large information processing directed at accounting and finance. COBOL is short for Common Business Oriented Language and was most recently updated in 2014\. Despite COBOL's steady decline, it is still widely used in old legacy mainframes and massive systems that have yet to be updated.

"\*[70-80% of all business transactions ][0]worldwide are written in COBOL today.

How many times have you waited in line at the bank for a simple transaction only to wait while the teller inputs your info in a 30-year-old clunky IT system. Chances are, most of your financial transactions are programmed in the 1959 COBOL language.</p></article>

But what's not emphasized often enough is there's a slowly increasing gap between the number of massive institutions relying on COBOL and its relevancy among programmers today."

COBOL is barely being taught in schools these days. Programmers believe that is it outdated, yet an incredible amount of companies use this technology. Most Point of Sales (POS) systems are programmed in COBOL. Ever been to Lowes or Belk and taken a gander at their computer screen or their manilla colored vintage IBM Machine that is bigger in the back than, well ya know. Read this image to get an idea of COBOL's impact (still from hacker rank).

### Why hasn't COBOL been replaced?

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. COBOL was created in 1959, when computer languages were being invented for specific purposes.

* Fortran → Scientific problems
* Lisp → Artificial intelligence
* Cobol → Business applications

"As banks, insurance companies and government institutions started joining the computer age, they'd create programming languages specific to their machines. You can imagine how costly and time-consuming this was. There needed to be a universal business language to carry out business operations faster." Now you see the need for COBOL.

Grace Hopper, the mother of COBOL, thought the syntax should be easily read by humans. This resulted in lengthy syntax, but it also served a wonderful purpose in a time when programming languages were only found in research labs.

"The Department of Defense even [decreed ][1]that all businesses must run on COBOL in the 1960s."

"Robert L. Glass [explains][2] that COBOL does the 4 essential business tasks better than most modern languages today:

* The capability for heterogenous "record-structure" data
* The capability for decimal arithmetic
* The capability for convenient report generation
* The capability for accessing and manipulating masses of data (typically made up of heterogenous data structure).

"COBOL is either good or adequate in all 4 (except for database access and GUI construction, they were designed into the language from the outset), whereas the COBOL replacement languages, like Visual Basic and Java are good at few if any of them," [Glass says][2]. And as language designers started to take more of a universal, flexible approach:

_"The unique capabilities of COBOL and the business reasons for them were lost in passage of time." - Robert Glass_

The Creators of COBOL invested over 2 trillion dollars into creating it, and many of the programs contain sensitive information about people including social security numbers, banking info, credit card info and healthcare records. Business currently run over 220 Billion lines of COBOL code. Changing all of these databases over would be a nearly impossible feat and the cost has not justified replacing it for many companies. However, I just happened to know someone who was hired for just such a task.

# Interview with a friend of mine, Viraj Patel, who was hired by Southern Freightline to develop a program to adapt their COBOL databases to SQL.

_How long did it take your team?: _It took their team 5 months to develop the program and 3 months to finish working out the bugs. He said that he now has a strong distaste for COBOL.

_Why would companies not continue to use COBOL?_ If a new company buys a $5,000 server there is no reason for them to put COBOL on the computer. First of all, these new servers are not designed to support COBOL databases because the hardware companies would not receive a high enough margin. They would be selling $5,000 servers designed for software that is very inexpensive. Also, COBOL was developed so long ago that even if they used COBOL as the database software they would not be getting the full potential out of it.

_Why did the company hire you to _design_this program if it is so expensive? _It was needed because the company forecasted continuous growth. To maintain the growth, the company needed to be more efficient. Keeping up with COBOL servers was not worth it for the company financially. They could pay your run of the mill software engineer $65k a year. The problem is that there are not a bunch of fresh meat COBOL devs running around. Your seasoned COBOL developer gets paid $150k a year and are in very high demand.

_So why not be a COBOL Dev? _I could not get a better answer than, the code is clunky and very annoying. The code is tedious and outdated. Developers and Software Engineers constantly want to be on the forefront of technology. Spending time learning such an old language seems to much of an archaic task for such brilliant minds. Develops do not like clunky, they can deal with a bit of tediousness, but modern develops are used to maximizing the efficiency of their code, and that was not a primary goal of COBOL.

There seems to be a tremendously serious business opportunity for the conversion of the COBOL databases. They also seem very difficult to maintain, which means they will inevitably break down. A company that is focused on transferring COBOL databased (I use the word transfer lightly, the task seems to be very specific to specific databases) would be successful in the near future. If a company could develop a single program to transfer these databases they would mint.

Why has IBM not developed this technology yet?

### The following is criticism of COBOL and IBM's tn3270x emulator that I wrote for an assignment as an undergraduate.

We are going to be looking at the current standard(ISO/IEC), and its use on IBM's servers through the tn3270x application. Despite its lasting legacy COBOL has multiple criticisms that need to be addressed. Another issue that ties all of them together is tn3270x's ease of use. The program has little instructions and has a high learning curve. In this proposal I will address each of the issues by providing documentation that will include easy to follow walkthrough on how to use COBOL and IBM's tn3270x.

The first problem I am going to address is the lack of structure while actually coding programs. COBOL is split into four different divisions, that are each vague in their description and use and would require hours of studying to understand enough to actually make them useful. COBOL lacks modularity so the programs are not user friendly and hard to read through to find information. This leads to monolithic and very hard to interpret programs even with the Object Oriented Programming update in 2002\. My solution to this would be to include detailed instructions that provide screenshots to help the user better understand how to structure their code. The instructions would include sample templates that show the best precedents set by previous programmers in regards to structure. It will also include detailed descriptions of each division within COBOL to better improve the user experience.

The second problem is that the syntax is incredibly verbose. The syntax does not accomplish its goals of being easy to understand and self documenting. The English language is very complicated and is not easily adapted to mathematics, hence over 300 reserved words. The code is easy to read, but not to understand or to use. My solution to this problem would be to include with every program a clear and well defined list of reserved words and syntax sorted by usefulness. This documentation would give users an understanding of the important words before they ever need to use them.

The third problem is the design and the user interface of the program. The aesthetics are complicated and unique and need documentation to explain how to use them. The documentation for the user interface would begin with a detailed explanation of the common different aspects of different screens that a user will need to use to effectively utilize the application. Next in the instructions would be how to interact with the user interface because of tn3270x's lack of mouse interaction and heavy keyboard focus. Basic navigational skills would follow in the documentation and would have an overview of important hotkeys, shortcuts, and reserved words. This documentation is necessary to increase the usability of the application and improve the user experience.
