## Section 1 -- Introduction with Review of Literature

A major trend in modern e-commerce is the rise of easily accessible e-commerce solutions which have greatly transformed the economic landscape. This paper begins by showing what e-commerce is and why a small business should consider implementing an e-commerce solution to keep up with the challenges of competing for a market share in the current economic climate. To follow is how the plethora of e-commerce solutions can greatly add to a business's value. Many of the different types of e-commerce solutions for small businesses are discussed to show how easily e-commerce can be added to a business. I intend to implement the strategies discussed in this research paper as a case study as I develop an e-commerce solution for a local Charleston business, Charleston Office Furniture Source.

The description of e-commerce and many supporting points as to why e-commerce is necessary come from Pearson's _E-Commerce 2017, 13th Edition_. The definition of e-commerce is bolstered with an Elsevier Information and Management Journal article, "A Literature Review and Classification of Electronic Commerce Research" by Elizabeth Grandon. The benefits of e-commerce are supported by another article from the same journal titled, "Electronic commerce adoption: an empirical study of small and medium US businesses: benefits of e-commerce." An article titled, "Business environment and internet commerce benefit---a small business perspective" by the European Journal of Information Systems provides information supporting implementation of e-commerce in small businesses. Statista.com, BigCommerce.com, and the US Department of Commerce are used to gather statistics on the current e-commerce climate. A report by IBM published in 2015 titled, "Shoppers disrupted: Retailing through the noise" provides insight into changing shopping trends and summation of the change.

## Section 2 -- Research Objective and Analysis

The scope of what actually defines e-commerce has grown exponentially in the past decade and there is no exhaustive definition as the topic continues to transform and grow, so I will provide multiple definitions. According to Pearson's _E-Commerce_, e-commerce is

"the use of the Internet, the Web, and mobile apps and browsers running on mobile devices to transact business. More formally, digitally enabled commercial transactions between and among organizations and individual." A literature review conducted in 2002 of over 270 academic journals defines e-commerce based on four perspective (Ngai):

* From a communications perspective, EC is the delivery of information, products/services, or payments via telephone lines, computer networks, or any other means.
* From a business process perspective, EC is the application of technology toward the automation of business transactions and workflow.
* From a service perspective, EC is a tool that addresses the desire of firms, consumers, and management to cut service costs while improving the quality of goods and increasing the speed of service delivery.
* From an online perspective, EC provides the capability of buying and selling products and information on the Internet and other online services.

For this paper we will use the definition from the journal by Grandon: "the process of buying and selling products or services using electronic data transmission via the Internet and the www." There are three type of E-commerce B2B, B2C, C2C. The most commonly discussed type of e-commerce and the type of e-commerce we will be addressing with the case study is business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, "in which online businesses attempt to reach individual consumers. B2C e-commerce includes purchases of retail goods, travel and other types of services, and online content" (Pearson 22) The next is Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, where business focus on selling to other businesses. B2B is the largest form of e-commerce. Despite B2C being what first comes to mind, according to Statista, B2B has 2.3 trillion in worldwide in 2017 while B2C boasted 7.7 trillion in worldwide sales in 2017 (Orendorff, Fig 3). The final type of e-commerce, consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce, "provides a way for consumers to sell to each other, with the help of an online market maker (also called a platform provider) such as eBay or Etsy, the classifieds site Craigslist, or on-demand service companies such as Airbnb and Uber. In C2C e-commerce, the consumer prepares the product for market, places the product for auction or sale, and relies on the market maker to provide catalog, search engine, and transaction-clearing capabilities so that products can be easily displayed, discovered, and paid for" (Pearson 24).

According to Pearson there are 8 unique aspects of e-commerce that make it so significant in business. These are ubiquity, global reach, universal standards, richness of information, interactivity, information density, personalization & customization, and social technology implementing user generated content and social networks. These are best shown alongside their business significance in their graphic (Table 1.2).

Why should a small business implement e-commerce? The statistics surrounding e-commerce are very supportive of adaptation. Global retail ecommerce Sales will reach $4.5 trillion by 2021 (Orendorff, Statista). By 2021 the e-commerce share of total global retail sales will be up to 17.5% (Statista, Fig 4). 53% of global internet users have made an online purchase in 2016 ([US Department of Commerce][1]), and 67% of Millennials prefer to shop online rather than in-store ([BigCommerce][2]) (Sleeknote). Countries with the largest B2C e-commerce markets in 2016 (in billion U.S. dollars) are China with $975 followed the US with $648.6 (Statista Fig 5). IBM sums up the growth wonderfully, "Shoppers have experienced tremendous disruption in the past four years. The explosion of online and mobile technologies, the spread of social networks, a new generation of advanced analytics -- all of these and more have combined to create an omnichannel environment that has completely transformed both the shopping experience and customer expectations. When and how will a "new normal" emerge, and what will it look like? To find out, the IBM Institute for Business Value analyzed more than 110,000 responses to global surveys from 2011-2014 to reveal how the speed and intensity of customers' changing attitudes and behaviors translate into must-haves for retailers." They found that nearly half of shoppers prefer to shop online and the perceived convenience has begun to shift from brick and mortar purchases to online purchases with 36% of shoppers in 2014 preferring online (up 23% from 2011). Trust between the players in a B2C interaction (trusted retailers) has also increased with 28% of customers being willing to share their location, 38% of shoppers being willing to share their social handles, and 42% are willing to share their mobile number.

It is clear that e-commerce is here to stay, but what are the benefits? E-commerce was previously only available to large companies but now it is available to the entrepreneur and small business. It is no longer a primary interest of companies, but a necessity. Inc.com sums up the benefits by saying, "Improving a business's ecommerce and internet marketing strategy can prevent a small retailer from falling behind their competitors and provide new sources of revenue as more consumers choose to shop online" (Roesler). Another general benefit is discussed by The Information and Management Journal, "E-commerce provides many benefits to both sellers and buyers; ...by implementing and using e-commerce sellers can access narrow markets segments that are widely distributed while buyers can benefit by accessing global markets with larger product availability from a variety of sellers at reduced costs. Improvement in product quality and the creation of new methods of selling existing products are also benefits" (Grandon).

The benefits and incentives are much more applicable. Starting a sales ready site is very easy to do and requires little programming knowledge. Free/low-cost services exist, but so do expensive custom options. E-commerce platforms level the playing field for small businesses against large competitors. A small business with a well-designed website can begin to compete with larger companies because of low internet marketing costs. E-commerce also facilitates very inexpensive product testing and trying new marketing tactics with quick feedback from customers. E-commerce platforms allow companies to "pivot quickly." A company can quickly change their e-commerce platform to incorporate new products and looks all the while "monitoring web traffic data and see how clients are responding" to the changes (BDC).

## Section 3 -- Results

How should a business should implement e-commerce? The benefits a company receives from the e-commerce platform provide insight into how the company should specifically implement their unique model. Here are 15 advantages of e-commerce for small businesses taken from Salvador Briggman's blog:

### 1\. Fewer costs

Without a physical storefront, setting up an e-commerce platform won't incur rental or management costs. The only costs will be the software you use to set up the online store, labor, and any money spent on marketing or advertising. Some suggestions for websites that will build the e-commerce are Shopify, BigCommerce, Volusion, Squarespace, WooCommerce, Magento, Prestashop, and OpenCart. These websites are a great starting point, but if a business becomes successful, a custom website will be the next step.

### 2\. Visitor tracking and statistics

Google analytics makes it extremely easy to see where people are finding the e-commerce website, which pages they are visiting, and from what region of the country they are hailing in from. Tools like Crazy Egg and MouseFlow allow the analysis of cursor movement as customers browse the web store. It would be very difficult to get these kinds of statistics regarding merchandise browsing patterns or visitor traffic with a physical store.

### 3\. Search engine traffic

Search engines are the holy grail of online activity. Rather than constantly pushing out marketing messages and trying to attract people to the store, a search engine will pair a customer's search queries with products and information that exists online. If it ranks well in a search engine like Google, then it will receive recurring monthly traffic that can convert into a steady flow of incoming sales. If the product is on Amazon, you can also get traffic from their search engine.

### 4\. Social media traffic

While at one point in time, only bloggers had the ability to voice opinions and influence buying patterns of new products. Now, **everyone** has the ability to speak their mind or recommend products to their friends on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Instagram, and more.

### 5\. Product inventory tracking

Since a purchase of the product is happening online, the order can easily be sent to the fulfillment company. Tracking where that product is in the fulfillment process as it's being shipped out to the customer is also available. One can also track how much of a product you have left in your storage unit or when you need to order more items from your wholesaler or manufacturer.

### 6\. Customer email communication

When a customer comes into a physical store, it's unlikely that to have the opportunity or ability to persuade them to give their email address. However, the online world is a completely different story! The store must obtain their email address to send them an order confirmation and you can have an opt-in box which will enable you to send them future offers or marketing messages. Some examples of free/paid email marketing tools are: Mailchimp, MadMini, INinbox, Aweber, GetResponse, ConstantConatact, Infusionsoft, Drip Marketing.

### 7\. Written word of mouth reviews

You might have raving fans in your local community, but unless those fans continually voice their appreciation of your store to new customers, you're going to have to **hope**that new customers check out your store. Online, it's easy to take advantage of customer reviews and reviews around the web to build credibility in the eyes of a potential customer.

### 8\. Automated customer feedback and support

Every business must deal with customer feedback, questions, and issues. No customer wants to go to a physical store location and have to search a support manual, mail in a question, fill out a survey card, or talk to a customer support representative from another country.

Ironically, many online customers are more than willing to search a online support forum, email in a question, fill out a customer survey, or take advantage of a businesses' 24-hour telephone support services, even if it means talking to someone in another country.

### 9\. Labor cost advantages

Just because the online store is in say, Massachusetts, doesn't mean that you need to set up a warehouse in Massachusetts or hire staff there. You can hire a staff member from out of the state or even out of the country to take advantage of tax or labor costs.

## 10\. Location-independent management

Similarly to point \#9, _**you**_ also don't need to be in Massachusetts in order to run your business. You could take a week off and be in Europe or on a beach in Malaysia, as long as you have a shipping and order fulfillment system in place.

### 11\. Larger marketplace and marketing ROI

A storefront will have a limited amount of potential customers based upon the georgraphic area. Once the domain name and online storefront is running, you've now entered a world marketplace and your marketing can bring in domestic or international customers. It's true that you'll be competing on a larger scale, but the wins or rewards that you receive from having great products and a good business are magnified.

### 12\. Automated marketing engine

The internet allows you to: Automate. Scale, and Build a location-independent business. You can automate your marketing with social media software, email management tools, and a blogging engine. Some recommendations for promoting the platform are: building an email list, Networking Events and Communities (Meetup.com, Eventbrite.com, Linkedin Groups /Facebook Groups/Google+ Communities), Starting a blog with guest blogs, cross promoting with other sellers on the same platform, use social media to promote not to sell. Some specific tools are:

Â§ [Buffer][3] or [Hootsuite][4] for social media scheduling and analytics

Â§ [Mailchimp][5] or [Aweber][6] for email scheduling and analytics

Â§ [WordPress][7] for blog post scheduling

Â§ [Google][8] and [Facebook][9] ads.

### 13\. Impulse purchases

Social media is an awesome opportunity to capitalize on **customer's** free time by attracting them to your web store with cool photos and discounts or offers. They might see something they like and decide to buy it directly from their mobile phone while they are on their lunch hour!

### 14\. Repeat customer and product data

Similar to search engine traffic, identifying repeat customers and particularly the products they buy most frequently is the golden goose of building a long-term successful business.

The analytics of a web store make it very easy to see which customers are your **best** customers and which products experience the **fastest** turnover.

If you were operating out of a physical location, your POS might have some of this functionality, but it's likely that you'd have to remember who your good customers are and the items that are the most high-margin and responsibility for the majority of your store's profit.

### 15\. Advertisement tracking

Finally, it's much easier to gauge and track the ROI of your marketing efforts through an online advertising platform like Google, Facebook, or BuySellAds. E-commerce platformsr can test messages, get click through data, and easily calculate your customer acquisition costs. It's harder to do that if you're doing a direct mail campaign, renting a banner on a freeway, or handing out flyers. You would need to make a tally of every customer that comes into your store and from which channel, which you could only do if you surveyed each one.

"One of the benefits about adding ecommerce to a business strategy is that it doesn't require much more than what is already available at the brick and mortar location" (Inc.com).

## Section 4 -- Conclusion

The rise of easily accessible e-commerce solutions have revolutionized businesses and have been essential building block in creating what is known today as e-commerce. With over 10 trillion dollars in the industry, e-commerce is here to stay and only continues to grow. Implementing an e-commerce solution is no longer negotiable for businesses. Small businesses can greatly increase their value, sales, customers, revenue, and brand name through an e-commerce platform. Not to mention competing with larger companies on a global scale for part of the internet market share. Implementing an e-commerce platform and an internet marketing strategy can prevent a small retailer from falling behind their competitors and provide new sources of revenue as more consumers choose to shop online.
