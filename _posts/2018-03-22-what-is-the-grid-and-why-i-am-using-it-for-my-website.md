Thread: Personal Development

## It is great for content generation and design inspiration, but lacks in many areas.

The Modern Computer Scientist must use everything at his disposal to maximize efficiency. Why I chose this platform to create my website, and my plans for migrating to another platform.

Web development is no longer reserved for programmers. I have finished my undergraduate career in Computer Science, so I definitely understand how to program, but I chose not to utilize that skill for my personal website. Programming is considerably time consuming, even for experienced developers and is completely unnecessary for the development for most websites. There are hundreds of different ways to develop personal blogs: Templates from the hundreds of sites that sell them, html templates with content management systems, static site generators, SaaS web dev companies, and AI technologies to name a few.

About three years ago, in 2015 going into my sophomore year of college I stumbled across and AI Web Development Technology called, The Grid. They were taking donations for lifetime memberships to aid in funding the program. I chose to sign up. I forgot that I even contributed and went on with my life. Three years later, when it came time to graduate and apply for jobs, I decided to create my own technology blog to organize my mental thoughts, notes, and showcase my research. Then, I remembered the Grid!

The Grid offers me lifetime hosting of up to 5 websites for free! Incredible! All that is required of me is to pay for the domain name registration and I have to utilize their platform.

Utilizing TheGrid.io platform greatly speeds up content creation and vastly improves the design of the website. I simply provide the content, create some basic structuring for the blog, choose some design preferences and theres the website! The downside is that I am forced to use their technology and have little custom control over the website. Worth it at this point in my life and for this project. The trick is going to be integrating other technologies into this website over time. I will need to get more involved with the community and see what other people are doing with their grid websites.

I am researching adding meta data to the website, adding comment sections to the blogs, adding a signature with a custom font, adding Google Analytics, adding a directory page, and pushing the embedded html to the max because it is limited at the moment.

Finally, I am supporting the future by utilizing a company built from AI technology. I do not believe that it is cheating. Technology is all about being on the bleeding edge. It is about being the most competitive and utilizing every tool to your advantage. This requires constant reading and focus. A modern computer scientist must know as much about every technology that exists, so that the next time he does something, he will be able to apply the technology to improve efficiency. This is one such example.

Update 5/8/18

I am utilizing The Grid to collect my thoughts and publish content quickly. I intend to transfer this content to a different website creation & management tool. I am currently interested in Duda and Wix. I believe content management systems like Wordpress will become deprecated.
