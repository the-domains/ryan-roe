With the release of cryptocurrency an unlimited set of opportunities have revealed themselves. This technology has created huge new markets. Cryptocurrency has challenged the global dollar standard, impacted the international monetary middleman, revolutionized the crowdfunding process, and impacts the stock market sending shock waves throughout the entire economy. The technology has created a conflict between centralization and decentralization that could change the entire landscape the global monetary system.

## Section 1 -- Introduction with Review of Literature

This paper provides a overview of cryptographic currency and its impact upon the economy. We being with a general overview of what cryptocurrency is and a history of where it came from and what it is doing now. An overview of cryptocurrency would not be complete without touching on block chain technology. Following are examples of real cryptocurrencies and a few of their varying successes and stories. We then discuss the impact of crypto currencies on the economy and open up a discussion on blockchain's impact on the economy. The technology is relatively new, so we will conclude with the impact these technologies will have in the future. The scope of this paper is to provide a very basic introduction to cryptographic currencies, block-chain technologies, and their impacts upon the e-commerce economy. Cryptocurrency and blockchain will have a tremendous impact upon the global economy that will begin slow and rise exponentially. This impact will revolutionize the global monetary systems and have negative and positive impacts.

Review of literature. The description of BitCoin and its technologies will come from a book written by Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, Edward Felten, Andrew Miller, Steven Goldfeder titled "_Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction."_Their book provides a very in depth study of the cryptology and block-chain to the point where one could create their own currency by the end of the book. The history and examples of cryptocurrency will be deduced from online articles written by credible sources, Forbes, Medium, and Bloomberg. The impacts of cryptocurrency and blockchain on the economy will be pulled from a book "_The Age of Cryptocurrency" _by Paul Vigna, Michael J. Casey. The core concepts of bitcoin and its impacts on the economy will also be deduced from an article in the Scientific American titled, "The World Bitcoin Created" by John Pavlus.

## Section 2 -- Research Objective and Analysis

So what is cryptography, cryptocurrency, and block-chain? Cryptocurrency is simply put, online cash where the seller and buyer are pseudo anonymous. "CRYPTOCURRENCY A form of digital currency that relies on the math ematics of cryptography to control how and when units of the currency are created and to ensure secure transfer of funds" (Pavlus).All currencies require a way to control the supply and enforce various security properties to prevent cheating. These are normally enforced by a centralized bank, but crypto currency relies upon decentralized peer to peer technology to create a ledger known as a block-chain to keep records of transactions. Crypto currencies make heavy use of cryptology to secure the rules of crypto system. Cryptography is a "deep academic research field using many advanced mathematical techniques that aree notoriously subtle and complicated" to hide information (Narayanan).

The core concepts of cryptocurrency are the Peer-To-Peer (P2P) Network "which is web of computers linked in a decentralized way, such that any computer can communicate directly with any other without going through a central server or other administrator." A Node is a computer connected to the P2P. A Distributed Ledger which is a "list of recorded, time-stamped transactions that is simultaneously broadcast, copied and verified via consensus across many different computers in a P2P network." A Block which is a "grouping of individual transaction records on a blockchain." Hashing is a one way cryptographic method used to condense data into a unique string of characters of a fixed length called a hash value. "Mining is the process by which nodes of a cryptocurrency network compete to securely add new blocks of transactions to a block-chain. Units of the currency are the reward---and hence, a financial incentive to ensure security." Block-chain is a reliable way for strangers to pass valuable information over a decentralized network (Pavlus).

Bitcoin was the first established cryptourrency but before it, there were multiple attemtps including B-Money and Bit Gold. Satoshi Nakamoto is the world's "most reclusive pseudonymous billionaire" 'In October 2008 Nakamoto published a paper via an obscure Internet mailing list detailing a design for the world's first blockchain: a public database distributed and synchronized every 10 minutes across thousands of computers, accessible to anyone and yet hackable by no one. Its purpose? To provide a decentralized, bulletproof record of exchange for a new digital currency Nakamoto called Bitcoin." (Pavlus). The problem that was solved was the one could not reliably prevent double spending across a network. The genius invention was the the Block-chain technology which create a distributed ledger thanks to cryptography. The Economist dubbed it "the trust machine" (Pavlus). Bitcoin was made public in 2009 through mining.

There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies on the market. They differ because of the technology behind them and in purpose. Bitcoin uses the famed blockchain technology and has achieved huge fame resulting in market spikes. Ethereum is another crypto currency that uses blockchain technology to initiate smart contracts. These smart contracts allow people to sign contracts at large distances at the same time. Ripple is another currency that uses blockchain to allow people to spend money across borders without transaction costs and the waiting that was previously required. The reason these technologies have coins with market caps is because it requires that someone own the coin to utilize the technology (Kharpal).

## Section 3 -- Results

Cryptocurrency and the technology behind it, blockchain, are known as disrupting the modern economy, but most of the attention has been given to the blockchain technology. The primary conflict created by cryptocurrencies is the challenge between centralization and decentralization. The following three ways that the economy is affected fall underneath that conflict (Narayanan).

The first way that cryptocurrencies affect the world economy is because it challenges the dollar standard. The entire world relies upon the US dollar as the reserve currency of the global economy. This essentially makes the US Treasury a "de facto global Central Bank". The global economy is more interconnected than every before because of the internet. "With the emergence of Bitcoin and all the over 1,000 cryptocoins, financial transactions are being decentralized on a massive scale. These decentralized transactions have no recourse whatsoever to the US Dollar. This changes the dynamics of international trade, foreign relations, diplomacy, and the impact of economic sanctions. There have always been attempts to "de-dollarize" the global economy and cryptocurrencies seem to be a veritable means of achieving that goal."State-owned cryptocurrencies have been looked at by Russia and Venezuela and in December of last year, the "Venezuelan President announced the launch of an oil-backed cryptocurrency to help move the country out of a crippling inflation brought on by US-led economic sanctions" (FindYourselfNow).

The second way the cryptocurrencies impact the economy is because they are beginning to cut out the middleman. Previously any international currency transaction had to occur through "entities like clearing houses, banks, and SWIFT. SWIFT stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication." With cryptocurrencies there is no need for a middleman because of the block-chain technology. It also cuts down transaction fees tremendously and it adds anonymity and privacy. This causes a huge disruption in the global payment system. This could also give rise to much more illegal activites such as money laundering and terrorism. "In September of 2017, Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt the Central Banking system and to revolutionize the concept of money" (FindYourselfNow).

The third way that cryptocurrency has impacted the global economy is because it has simplified the crowdfunding process. Previously developers had to convince venture capitalists and angel investors or rely on huge website communities. Now, when a new technology is invented they can just create an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund their projects. ICO's have become a focus of governments worldwide. 'China banned ICOs in late 2017 and the SEC issued a ruling some ICOs were in fact securities. Many countries have placed tighter restrictions on ICO. If it wasn't disrupting the market, it wouldn't cause this much of an uproar" (FindYourselfNow).

According to Bloomberg, cryptocurrency prices are having a real impact on the stock market. Companies that show they are positioned to benefit from block-chain technology experience real rewards in their stock prices. "The new symbol of this movement might be Longfin Corp., whose stock rallied over 2,000 percent in a week after announcing it bought a "blockchain-empowered global micro-lending solutions provider." When stocks surge based on press releases like this, it's important not to get too caught up in the details of the announcement or what it means for the business; the hype itself is what causes such distortions in markets" (Sen). With the surge hundreds of different technologies being backed by hundreds of different coins, this impact could have huge implications on businesses.

## Section 4 -- Conclusion
